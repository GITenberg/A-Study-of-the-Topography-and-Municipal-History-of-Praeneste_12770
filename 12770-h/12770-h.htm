<h2>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>This study is the first of a series of studies already in
progress, in which the author hopes to make some contributions
to the history of the towns of the early Latin League,
from the topographical and epigraphical points of view.</p>
<p>The author takes this opportunity to thank Dr. Kirby
Flower Smith, Head of the Department of Latin, at whose
suggestion this study was begun, and under whose supervision
and with whose hearty assistance its revision was
completed.</p>
<p>He owes his warmest thanks also to Dr. Harry Langford
Wilson, Professor of Roman Arch&aelig;ology and Epigraphy,
with whom he made many trips to Pr&aelig;neste, and whose
help and suggestions were most valuable.</p>
<p>Especially does he wish to testify to the inspiration to
thoroughness which came from the teaching and the example
of his dearly revered teacher, Professor Basil Lanneau Gildersleeve,
Head of the Greek Department, and he acknowledges
also with pleasure the benefit from the scholarly
methods of Dr. David M. Robinson, and the manifold suggestiveness
of the teaching of Dr. Maurice Bloomfield.</p>
<p>The cordial assistance of the author's aunt, Dr. Esther B.
Van Deman, Carnegie Fellow in the American School at
Rome, both during his stay in Rome and Pr&aelig;neste and since
his return to America, has been invaluable, and the privilege
afforded him by Professor Dr. Christian H&uuml;lsen, of the German
Arch&aelig;ological Institute, of consulting the as yet unpublished
indices of the sixth volume of the Corpus Inscriptionum
Latinarum, is acknowledged with deep gratitude.</p>
<p>The author is deeply grateful for the facilities afforded
him in the prosecution of his investigations while he was
a resident in Palestrina, and he takes great pleasure in
thanking for their courtesies, Cav. Capitano Felice Cicerchia,
President of the Arch&aelig;ological Society at Palestrina, his
brother, Cav. Emilio Cicerchia, Government Inspector of
Antiquities, Professor Pompeo Bernardini, Mayor of the
City, and Cav. Francesco Coltellacci, Municipal Secretary.</p>
<p>Finally, he desires to express his cordial appreciation of
the kind advice and generous assistance given by Professor
John Martin Vincent in connection with the publication of
this monograph.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.
</h2>
<h2>THE TOPOGRAPHY OF PR&AElig;NESTE.</h2>
<p>Nearly a half mile out from the rugged Sabine mountains,
standing clear from them, and directly in front of
the sinuous little valley which the northernmost headstream
of the Trerus made for itself, rises a conspicuous and commanding
mountain, two thousand three hundred and eighteen
feet above the level of the sea, and something more
than half that height above the plain below. This limestone
mountain, the modern Monte Glicestro, presents on the north
a precipitous and unapproachable side to the Sabines, but
turns a fairer face to the southern and western plain.
From its conical summit the mountain stretches steeply
down toward the southwest, dividing almost at once into
two rounded slopes, one of which, the Colle di S. Martino,
faces nearly west, the other in a direction a little west of
south. On this latter slope is situated the modern Palestrina,
which is built on the site of the ancient Pr&aelig;neste.</p>
<p>From the summit of the mountain, where the arx or
citadel was, it becomes clear at once why Pr&aelig;neste occupied
a proud and commanding position among the towns of
Latium. The city, clambering up the slope on its terraces,
occupied a notably strong position<a name="FNanchor_1"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>, and the citadel
was wholly impregnable to assault. Below and south
of the city stretched fertile land easy of access to the
Pr&aelig;nestines, and sufficiently distant from other strong
Latin towns to be safe for regular cultivation. Further,
there is to be added to the fortunate situation
of Pr&aelig;neste with regard to her own territory and that of
her contiguous dependencies, her position at a spot which
almost forced upon her a wide territorial influence, for
Monte Glicestro faces exactly the wide and deep depression
between the Volscian mountains and the Alban Hills, and
is at the same time at the head of the Trerus-Liris valley.
Thus Pr&aelig;neste at once commanded not only one of the
passes back into the highland country of the &AElig;quians, but
also the inland routes between Upper and Lower Italy, the
roads which made relations possible between the Hernicans,
Volscians, Samnites, and Latins. From Pr&aelig;neste the
movements of Volscians and Latins, even beyond the Alban
Hills and on down in the Pontine district, could be seen,
and any hostile demonstrations could be prepared against
or forestalled. In short, Pr&aelig;neste held the key to Rome
from the south.</p>
<p>Monte Glicestro is of limestone pushed up through the
tertiary crust by volcanic forces, but the long ridges
which run off to the northwest are of lava, while the shorter
and wider ones extending toward the southwest are of
tufa. These ridges are from three to seven miles in length.
It is shown either by remains of roads and foundations or
(in three cases) by the actual presence of modern towns
that in antiquity the tip of almost every one of these ridges
was occupied by a city. The whole of the tufa and lava
plain that stretches out from Pr&aelig;neste toward the Roman
Campagna is flat to the eye, and the towns on the tips of
the ridges seem so low that their strong military position
is overlooked. The tops of these ridges, however, are
everywhere more than an hundred feet above the valley
and, in addition, their sides are very steep. Thus the
towns were practically impregnable except by an attack
along the top of the ridge, and as all these ridges run back
to the base of the mountain on which Pr&aelig;neste was situated,
both these ridges and their towns necessarily were always
closely connected with Pr&aelig;neste and dependent upon her.</p>
<p>There is a simple expedient by which a conception of the
topography of the country about Pr&aelig;neste can be obtained.
Place the left hand, palm down, flat on a table spreading
the fingers slightly, then the palm of the right hand on the
back of the left with the fingers pointing at right angles to
those of the left hand. Imagine that the mountain, on
which Pr&aelig;neste lay, rises in the middle of the back of the
upper hand, sinks off to the knuckles of both hands, and
extends itself in the alternate ridges and valleys which the
fingers and the spaces between them represent.</p>
<br />
<p><a name="EXTENT"></a>EXTENT OF THE DOMAIN OF PR&AElig;NESTE.</p>
<p>Just as the modern roads and streets in both country and
city of ancient territory are taken as the first and best proof
of the presence of ancient boundary lines and thoroughfares,
just so the territorial jurisdiction of a city in modern
Italy, where tradition has been so constant and so strong,
is the best proof for the extent of ancient domain.<a name="FNanchor_2"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> Before
trying, therefore, to settle the limits of the domain of Pr&aelig;neste
from the provenience of ancient inscriptions, and by
deductions from ancient literary sources, and present topographical
and arch&aelig;ological arguments, it will be well worth
while to trace rapidly the diocesan boundaries which the
Roman church gave to Pr&aelig;neste.</p>
<p>The Christian faith had one of its longest and hardest
fights at Pr&aelig;neste to overcome the old Roman cult of
Fortuna Primigenia. Christianity triumphed completely,
and Pr&aelig;neste was so important a place, that it was made
one of the six suburban bishoprics,<a name="FNanchor_3"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> and from that time on
there is more or less mention in the Papal records of the
diocese of Pr&aelig;neste, or Penestrino as it began to be called.</p>
<p>In the fifth century A.D. there is mention of a gift to
a church by Sixtus III, Pope from 432 to 440, of a certain
possession in Pr&aelig;nestine territory called Marmorata,<a
 name="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> which
seems best located near the town of Genazzano.</p>
<p>About the year 970 the territory of Pr&aelig;neste was increased
in extent by Pope John XIII, who ceded to his
sister Stefania a territory that extended back into the mountains
to Aqua alta near Subiaco, and as far as the Rivo lato
near Genazzano, and to the west and north from the head
of the Anio river to the Via Labicana.<a name="FNanchor_5"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>
<p>A few years later, in 998, because of some troubles, the
domain of Pr&aelig;neste was very much diminished. This is
of the greatest importance here, because the territory of
the diocese in 998 corresponds almost exactly not only to
the natural boundaries, but also, as will be shown later, to
the ancient boundaries of her domain. The extent of this
restricted territory was about five by six miles, and took in
Zagarolo, Valmontone, Cave, Rocca di Cave, Capranica,
Poli, and Gallicano.<a name="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>
These towns form a circle around
Pr&aelig;neste and mark very nearly the ancient boundary. The
towns of Valmontone, Cave, and Poli, however, although
in a great degree dependent upon Pr&aelig;neste, were, I think,
just outside her proper territorial domain.</p>
<p>In 1043, when Emilia, a descendant of the Stefania mentioned
above, married Stefano di Colonna, Count of Tusculum,
Pr&aelig;neste's territory seems to have been enlarged again
to its former extent, because in 1080 at Emilia's death, Pope
Gregory VII excommunicated the Colonna because they
insisted upon retaining the Pr&aelig;nestine territory which had
been given as a fief to Stefania, and which upon Emilia's
death should have reverted to the Church.<a name="FNanchor_7"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>
<p>We get a glance again at the probable size of the Pr&aelig;nestine
diocese in 1190, from the fact that the fortieth bishop
of Pr&aelig;neste was Giovanni Anagnino de' Conti di Segni
(1190-1196),<a name="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a>
and this seems to imply a further extension
of the diocese to the southeast down the Trerus (Sacco)
valley.</p>
<p>Again, in 1300 after the papal destruction of Palestrina,
the government of the city was turned over to Cardinal
Ranieri, who was to hold the city and its castle (mons),
the mountain and its territory. At this time the diocese comprised
the land as far as Artena (Monte Fortino) and
and Rocca Priora, one of the towns in the Alban Hills, and
to Castrum Novum Tiburtinum, which may well be
Corcolle.<a name="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>
<p>The natural limits of the ancient city proper can hardly be
mistaken. The city included not only the arx and that portion
of the southern slope of the mountain which was
walled in, but also a level piece of fertile ground below the
city, across the present Via degli Arconi. This piece of flat
land has an area about six hundred yards square, the natural
boundaries of which are: on the west, the deep bed of the
watercourse spanned by the Ponte dei Sardoni; on the east,
the cut over which is built the Ponte dell' Ospedalato, and
on the south, the depression running parallel to the Via
degli Arconi, and containing the modern road from S.
Rocco to Cave.</p>
<p>From the natural limits of the town itself we now pass to
what would seem to have been the extent of territory dependent
upon her. The strongest argument of this discussion
is based upon the natural configuration of the land.
To the west, the domain of Pr&aelig;neste certainly followed
those long fertile ridges accessible only from Pr&aelig;neste.
First, and most important, it extended along the very wide
ridge known as Le Tende and Le Colonnelle which stretches
down toward Gallicano. Some distance above that town
it splits, one half, under the name of Colle S. Rocco, running
out to the point on which Gallicano is situated, and
the other, as the Colle Caipoli, reaching farther out into
the Campagna. Along and across this ridge ran several
ancient roads.<a name="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a>
With the combination of fertile ground
well situated, in a position farthest away from all hostile
attack, and a location not only in plain sight from
the citadel of Pr&aelig;neste, but also between Pr&aelig;neste and
her closest friend and ally, Tibur, it is certain that in
this ridge we have one of the most favored and valuable
of Pr&aelig;neste's possessions, and quite as certain that Gallicano,
probably the ancient Pedum,<a name="FNanchor_11"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> was one of the towns
which were dependent allies of Pr&aelig;neste. It was along
this ridge too that probably the earlier, and certainly the
more intimate communication between Pr&aelig;neste and Tibur
passed, for of the three possible routes, this was both the
nearest and safest.<a name="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 512px; height: 415px;"
 alt="PLATE I. Pr&aelig;neste, on mountain in background; Gallicano, on top of ridge, in foreground"
 title="PLATE I. Pr&aelig;neste, on mountain in background; Gallicano, on top of ridge, in foreground"
 src="images/imag001.jpg" /></p>
<p>The second ridge, called Colle di Pastore as far as the
Gallicano cut, and Colle Collafri beyond it, along which for
four miles runs the Via Pr&aelig;nestina, undoubtedly belonged
to the domain of Pr&aelig;neste.<a name="FNanchor_13"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> But it was not so important a
piece of property as the ridges on either side, for it is much
narrower, and it had no town at its end. There was probably
always a road out this ridge, as is shown by the presence
of the later Via Pr&aelig;nestina, but that there was no
town at the end of the ridge is well proved by the fact that
Ashby finds no remains there which give evidence of one.
Then, too, we have plain enough proof of general unfitness
for a town. In the first place the ridge runs oil into the
junction of two roadless valleys, there is not much fertile
land back of where the town site would have been, but
above all, however, it is certain that the Via Pr&aelig;nestina was
an officially made Roman road, and did not occupy anything
more than a previous track of little consequence. This is
shown by the absence of tombs of the early necropolis style
along this road.</p>
<p>The next ridge must always have been one of the most
important, for from above Cavamonte as far as Passerano,
at the bottom of the ridge on the side toward Rome, connecting
with the highway which was the later Via Latina,
ran the main road through Zagarolo, Passerano, Corcolle, on
to Tibur and the north.<a name="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a>
As this was the other of the two
great roads which ran to the north without getting out on
the Roman Campagna, it is certain that Pr&aelig;neste considered
it in her territory, and probably kept the travel well in
hand. With dependent towns at Zagarolo and Passerano,
which are several miles distant from each other, there must
have been at least one more town between them, to guard
the road against attack from Tusculum or Gabii. The fact
that the Via Pr&aelig;nestina later cut the Colle del Pero-Colle
Seloa just below a point where an ancient road ascends the
ridge to a place well adapted for a town, and where there
are some remains,<a name="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15"><sup>[15]</sup></a>
seems to prove the supposition, and to
locate another of the dependent cities of Pr&aelig;neste.</p>
<p>That the next ridge, the one on which Zagarolo is situated,
was also part of Pr&aelig;neste's territory, aside from the fact
that it has always been part of the diocese of Pr&aelig;neste, is
clearly shown by the topography of the district. The only
easy access to Zagarolo is from Palestrina, and although the
town itself cannot be seen from the mountain of Pr&aelig;neste,
nevertheless the approach to it along the ridge is clearly
visible.</p>
<p>The country south and in front of Pr&aelig;neste spreads out
more like a solid plain for a mile or so before splitting off
into the ridges which are so characteristic of the neighborhood.
East of the ridge on which Zagarolo stands, and
running nearly at right angles to it, is a piece of territory
along which runs the present road (the Omata di Palestrina)
to the Palestrina railroad station, and which as far
as the cross valley at Colle dell'Aquila, is incontestably
Pr&aelig;nestine domain.</p>
<p>But the territory which most certainly belonged to Pr&aelig;neste,
and which was at once the most valuable and the
oldest of her possessions is the wide ridge now known
as the Vigne di Loreto, along which runs the road to
Marcigliano.<a name="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16"><sup>[16]</sup></a>
Not only does this ridge lie most closely
bound to Pr&aelig;neste by nature, but it leads directly toward
Velitr&aelig;, her most advantageous ally. Tibur was perhaps
always Pr&aelig;neste's closest and most loyal ally, but the alliance
with her had not the same opportunity for mutual
advantage as one with Velitr&aelig;, because each of these towns
commanded the territory the other wished to know most
about, and both together could draw across the upper Trerus
valley a tight line which was of the utmost importance from
a strategic point of view. These two facts would in themselves
be a satisfactory proof that this ridge was Pr&aelig;neste's
first expansion and most important acquisition, but there is
proof other than topographical and argumentative.</p>
<p>At the head of this ridge in la Colombella, along the road
leading to Marcigliano from the little church of S. Rocco,
have been found three strata of tombs. The line of graves
in the lowest stratum, the date of which is not later than
the fifth or sixth century B.C., points exactly along the
ancient road, now the Via della Marcigliana or di Loreto.<a
 name="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17"><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>
<p>The natural limit of Pr&aelig;nestine domain to the south has
now been reached, and that it is actually the natural limit is
shown by the accompanying illustration.</p>
<p>Through the Valle di Pepe or Fosso dell' Ospedalato
(see <a href="#plate_ii">Plate II</a>), which is wide as well as deep,
runs the
uppermost feeder of the Trerus river. One sees at a glance
that the whole slope of the mountain from arx to base is
continued by a natural depression which would make an
ideal boundary for Pr&aelig;nestine territory. Nor is the topographical
proof all. No inscriptions of consequence, and
no architectural remains of the pre-imperial period have
been found across this valley. The road along the top of
the ridge beyond it is an ancient one, and ran to Valmontone
as it does today, and was undoubtedly often used
between Pr&aelig;neste and the towns on the Volscians. The
ridge, however, was exposed to sudden attack from too
many directions to be of practical value to Pr&aelig;neste.
Valmontone, which lay out beyond the end of this ridge,
commanded it, and Valmontone was not a dependency of
Pr&aelig;neste, as is shown by an inscription which mentions the
adlectio of a citizen there into the senate (decuriones) of
Pr&aelig;neste.<a name="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18"><sup>[18]</sup></a></p>
<p>There are still two other places which as we have seen
were included at different times in the papal diocese of
Pr&aelig;neste,<a name="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19"><sup>[19]</sup></a>
namely, Capranica and Cave.<a name="FNanchor_20"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_20"><sup>[20]</sup></a> Inscriptional
evidence is not forthcoming in either place sufficient to warrant
any certainty in the matter of correspondence of local
names to those in Pr&aelig;neste. Of the two, Capranica had
much more need of dependence on Pr&aelig;neste than Cave. It
was down through the little valley back of Pr&aelig;neste, at
the head of which Capranica lay, that her later aqueducts
came. The outlet from Capranica back over the mountains
was very difficult, and the only tillable soil within reach of
that town lay to the north of Pr&aelig;neste on the ridge running
toward Gallicano, and on a smaller ridge which curved
around toward Tibur and lay still closer to the mountains.
In short, Capranica, which never attained importance
enough to be of any consequence, appears to have been
always dependent upon Pr&aelig;neste.</p>
<p>But as for Cave, that is another question. Her friends
were to the east, and there was easy access into the mountains
to Sublaqueum (Subiaco) and beyond, through the
splendid passes via either of the modern towns, Genazzano
or Olevano.</p>

<p>It is quite evident that Cave was never a large town, and
it seems most probable that she realized that an amicable
understanding with Pr&aelig;neste was discreet. This is rendered
almost certain by the proof of a continuance of business
relations between the two places. The greater number of
the big tombs of the sixth and fifth centuries B.C. are of
a peperino from Cave,<a name="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21"><sup>[21]</sup></a>
and a good deal of the tufa used
in wall construction in Pr&aelig;neste is from the quarries near
Cave, as Fernique saw.<a name="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22"><sup>[22]</sup></a></p>
<p>Rocca di Cave, on a hill top behind Cave, is too insignificant
a location to have been the cause of the lower town,
which at the best does not itself occupy a very advantageous
position in any way, except that it is in the line of a trade
route from lower Italy. It might be maintained with some
reason that Cave was a settlement of dissatisfied merchants
from Pr&aelig;neste, who had gone out and established themselves
on the main road for the purpose of anticipating the
trade, but there is much against such an argument.</p>
<p>It has been shown that there were peaceable relations
between Pr&aelig;neste and Cave in the fifth and sixth centuries
B.C., but that the two towns were on terms of equality is
impossible, and that Cave was a dependency of Pr&aelig;neste,
and in her domain, is most unlikely both topographically
and epigraphically. And more than this, just as an ancient
feud can be proved between Pr&aelig;neste and Rome from the
slurs on Pr&aelig;neste which one finds in literature from Plautus
down,<a name="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23"><sup>[23]</sup></a>
if no other proofs were to be had,<a name="FNanchor_24"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_24"><sup>[24]</sup></a> just so there
is a very ancient grudge between Pr&aelig;neste and Cave, which
has been perpetuated and is very noticeable even at the
present day.<a name="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25"><sup>[25]</sup></a></p>
<p>The topography of Pr&aelig;neste as to the site of the city
proper, and as to its territorial domain is then, about as
follows.</p>
<p>In very early times, probably as early as the ninth or
tenth century B.C., Pr&aelig;neste was a town on the southern
slope of Monte Glicestro,<a name="FNanchor_26"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_26"><sup>[26]</sup></a> with an arx on the summit.
As the town grew, it spread first to the level ground
directly below, and out along the ridge west of the Valle di
Pepe toward Marcigliano, because it was territory not only
fertile and easily defended, being directly under the very
eyes of the citizens, but also because it stretched out toward
Velitr&aelig;, an old and trusted ally.<a name="FNanchor_27"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_27"><sup>[27]</sup></a></p>
<p>Her next expansion was in the direction of Tibur, along
the trade route which followed the Sabine side of the Liris-Trerus
valley, and this expansion gave her a most fertile
piece of territory. To insure this against incursions from
the pass which led back into the mountains, it seems certain
that Pr&aelig;neste secured or perhaps colonized Capranica.</p>
<p>The last Pr&aelig;nestine expansion in territory had a motive
beyond the acquisition of land, for it was also important
from a strategical point of view. It will be remembered
that the second great trade route which came into the
Roman plain ran past Zagarolo, Passerano, and Corcolle.<a
 name="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28"><sup>[28]</sup></a>
This road runs along a valley just below ridges which radiate
from the mountain on which Pr&aelig;neste is situated, and
thus bordered the land which was by nature territory
dependent upon Pr&aelig;neste.<a name="FNanchor_29"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_29"><sup>[29]</sup></a> So this final extension of her
domain was to command this important road. With the
carrying out of this project all the ridges mentioned above
came gradually into the possession of Praneste, as natural,
expedient, and unquestioned domain, and on the ends of
those ridges which were defensible, dependent towns grew
up. There was also a town at Cavamonte above the
Maremmana road, probably a village out on the Colle
dell'Oro, and undoubtedly one at Marcigliano, or in that
vicinity.</p>
<p>We have already seen that across a valley and a stream of
some consequence there is a ridge not at all connected
with the mountain on which Pr&aelig;neste was situated, but
belonging rather to Valmontone, which was better suited
for neutral ground or to act as a buffer to the southeast.
We turn to mention this ridge again as territory topographically
outside Pr&aelig;neste's domain, in order to say more forcibly
that one must cross still another valley and stream
before reaching the territory of Cave, and so Cave, although
dependent upon Pr&aelig;neste, by reason of its size and interests,
was not a dependent city of Pr&aelig;neste, nor was it a
part of her domain.<a name="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30"><sup>[30]</sup></a></p>
<p>In short, to describe Pr&aelig;neste, that famous town of
Latium, and her domain in a true if homely way, she was
an ancient and proud city whose territory was a commanding
mountain and a number of ridges running out from it,
which spread out like a fan all the way from the Fosso
dell'Ospedalato (the depression shown in <a href="#plate_ii">plate II</a>)
to the
Sabine mountains on the north.</p>
<br />
<p><a name="CITY"></a>THE CITY, ITS WALLS AND GATES.</p>
<p>The general supposition has been that the earliest inhabitants
of Pr&aelig;neste lived only in the citadel on top of the
hill. This theory is supported by the fact that there is
room enough, and, as will be shown below, there was in
early times plenty of water there; nevertheless it is certain
that this was not the whole of the site of the early city.</p>
<p>The earliest inhabitants of Pr&aelig;neste needed first of all,
safety, then a place for pasturage, and withal, to be as close
to the fertile land at the foot of the mountain as possible.
The first thing the inhabitants of the new city did was to
build a wall. There is still a little of this oldest wall in the
circuit about the citadel, and it was built at exactly the same
time as the lower part of the double walls that extend down
the southern slope of the mountain on each side of the
upper part of the modern town. It happens that by following
the edges of the slope of this southern face of the
mountain down to a certain point, one realizes that even
without a wall the place would be practically impregnable.
Add to this the fact that all the stones necessary for a wall
were obtained during the scarping of the arx on the side
toward the Sabines,<a name="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31"><sup>[31]</sup></a>
and needed only to be rolled down,
not up, to their places in the wall, which made the task a
very easy one comparatively. Now if a place can be found
which is naturally a suitable place for a lower cross wall,
we shall have what an ancient site demanded; first, safety,
because the site now proposed is just as impregnable as the
citadel itself, and still very high above the plain below;
second, pasturage, for on the slope between the lower town
and the arx is the necessary space which the arx itself
hardly supplies; and third, a more reasonable nearness to
the fertile land below. All the conditions necessary are fulfilled
by a cross wall in Pr&aelig;neste, which up to this time has
remained mostly unknown, often neglected or wrongly
described, and wholly misunderstood. As we shall see,
however, this very wall was the lower boundary of the
earliest Pr&aelig;neste. The establishment of this important fact
will remove one of the many stumbling blocks over which
earlier writers on Pr&aelig;neste have fallen.</p>
<p>It has been said above that the lowest part of the wall
of the arx, and the two walls from it down the mountain
were built at the same time. The accompanying plate
(<a href="#plate_iii">III</a>) shows very plainly the course of the
western wall
as it comes down the hill lining the edge of the slope
where it breaks off most sharply. Porta San Francesco,
the modern gate, is above the second tree from the
right in the illustration, just where the wall seems to
turn suddenly. There is no trace of ancient wall after the
gate is passed. The white wall, as one proceeds from the
gate to the right, is the modern wall of the Franciscan monastery.
All the writers on Pr&aelig;neste say that the ancient
wall came on around the town where the lower wall of the
monastery now is, and followed the western limit of the
present town as far as the Porta San Martino.</p>
<p>Returning now to plate II we observe a thin white line
of wall which joins a black line running off at an angle to
our left. This is also a piece of the earliest cyclopean wall,
and it is built just at the eastern edge of the hill where it
falls off very sharply.</p>
<p>Now if one follows the Via di San Francesco in from the
gate of that name (see <a href="#plate_iii">plate III</a> again) and
then continues
down a narrow street east of the monastery as far as the
open space in front of the church of Santa Maria del Carmine,
he will see that on his left above him the slope of the
mountain was not only precipitous by nature but that also
it has been rendered entirely unassailable by scarping.<a
 name="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32"><sup>[32]</sup></a>
From the lower end of this steep escarpment there is a
cyclopean wall, of the same date as the upper side walls
of the town, and the wall of the arx, which runs entirely
across the city to within a few yards of the wall on the east,
and to a point just below a portella, where the upper cyclopean
wall makes a slight change in direction. The presence
of the gate and the change of direction in the wall mean
a corner in the wall.</p>

</p>
<h5>PLATE III. The western cyclopean wall of Pr&aelig;neste, and the
depression which divides
Monte Glicestro.</h5>
<p>It is strange indeed that this wall has not been recognized
for what it really is. A bit of it shows above the steps
where the Via dello Spregato leaves the Via del Borgo.
Fernique shows this much in his map, but by a curious
oversight names it opus incertum.<a name="FNanchor_33"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_33"><sup>[33]</sup></a> More than
two irregular courses are to be seen here, and fifteen
feet in from the street, forming the back wall of cellars
and pig pens, the cyclopean wall, in places to a height
of fifteen feet or more, can be followed to within a few
yards of the open space in front of Santa Maria del Carmine.
And on the other side toward the east the same wall
begins again, after being broken by the Via dello Spregato,
and forms the foundations and side walls of the houses on
the south side of that street, and at the extreme east end
is easily found as the back wall of a blacksmith's shop at
the top of the Via della Fontana, and can be identified as
cyclopean by a little cleaning of the wall.</p>
<p>The circuit of the earliest cyclopean wall and natural
ramparts of the contemporaneous citadel and town of Pr&aelig;neste
was as follows: An arc of cyclopean wall below the
cap of the hill which swung round from the precipitous
cliff on the west to that on the east, the whole of the side
of the arx toward the mountains being so steep that no
wall was necessary; then a second loop of cyclopean wall
from the arx down the steep western edge of the southern
slope of the mountain as far as the present Porta San
Francesco. From this point natural cliffs reinforced at the
upper end by a short connecting wall bring us to the beginning
of the wall which runs across the town back of the
Via del Borgo from Santa Maria del Carmine to within a
short distance of the east wall of the city, separated from
it in fact only by the Via della Fontana, which runs up just
inside the wall. There it joins the cyclopean wall which
comes down from the citadel on the east side of the town.</p>
<p>The reasons why this is the oldest circuit of the city's
walls are the following: first, all this stretch of wall is the
oldest and was built at the same time; second, topography
has marked out most clearly that the territory inclosed by
these walls, here and only here, fulfills the two indispensable
requisites of the ancient town, namely space and defensibility;
third, below the gate San Francesco all the way
round the city as far as Porta del Sole, neither in the wall
nor in the buildings, nor in the valley below, is there any
trace of cyclopean wall stones;<a name="FNanchor_34"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_34"><sup>[34]</sup></a> fourth, at the point where
the cross wall and the long wall must have met at the east,
the wall makes a change in direction, and there is an ancient
postern gate just above the jog in the wall; and last, the
cyclopean wall from this junction on down to near the
Porta del Sole is later than that of the circuit just
described.<a name="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35"><sup>[35]</sup></a></p>
<p>The city was extended within a century perhaps, and the
new line of the city wall was continued on the east in
cyclopean style as far as the present Porta del Sole, where it
turned to the west and continued until the hill itself offered
enough height so that escarpment of the natural cliff would
serve in place of the wall. Then it turned up the hill between
the present Via San Biagio and Via del Carmine back of
Santa Maria del Carmine. The proof for this expansion
is clear. The continuation of the cyclopean
wall can be seen now as far as the Porta del Sole,<a name="FNanchor_36"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_36"><sup>[36]</sup></a>
and the line of the wall which turns to the west
is positively known from the cippi of the ancient pomerium,
which were found in 1824 along the present Via
degli Arconi.<a name="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37"><sup>[37]</sup></a>
The ancient gate, now closed, in the opus
quadratum wall under the Cardinal's garden, is in direct
line with the ancient pavement of the road which comes up
to the city from the south,<a name="FNanchor_38"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_38"><sup>[38]</sup></a> and the continuation of that
road, which seems to have been everywhere too steep for
wagons, is the Via del Carmine. There had always been
another road outside the wall which went up a less steep
grade, and came round the angle of the wall at what is now
the Porta S. Martino, where it entered a gate that opened
out of the present Corso toward the west. When at a later
time, probably in the middle ages, the city was built out to
its present boundary on the west, the wagon road was simply
arched over, and this arch is now the gate San Martino.<a
 name="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39"><sup>[39]</sup></a></p>
<p>It will be necessary to speak further of the cyclopean wall
on the east side of the city from the Porta del Sole to the
Portella, for it has always been supposed that this part of
the wall was exactly like the rest, and dated from the same
period. But a careful examination shows that the stones
in this lower portion are laid more regularly than those in
the wall above the Portella, that they are more flatly faced
on the outside, and that here and there a little mortar is
used. Above all, however, there is in the wall on one of the
stones under the house no. 24, Via della Fontana an inscription,<a
 name="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40"><sup>[40]</sup></a>
which Richter, Dressel, and Dessau all think was
there when the stone was put in the wall, and incline to
allow no very remote date for the building of the wall at
that point. To me, after a comparative study of this wall
and the one at Norba, the two seem to date from very nearly
the same time, and no one now dares attribute great antiquity
to the walls of Norba. But the rest of the cyclopean
wall of Pr&aelig;neste is very ancient, certainly a century, perhaps
two or three centuries, older than the part from the Portella
down.</p>
<p>There remains still to be discussed the lower wall of the
city on the south, and a restraining terrace wall along part
of the present Corso Pierluigi. The stretch of city wall
from the Porta del Sole clear across the south front to the
Porta di S. Martino is of opus quadratum, with the exception
of a stretch of opus incertum<a name="FNanchor_41"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_41"><sup>[41]</sup></a> below and east of the
Barberini gardens, and a small space where the city sewage
has destroyed all vestige of a wall. The restraining wall
just mentioned is also of opus quadratum and is to be found
along the south side of the Corso, but can be seen only from
the winecellars on the terrace below that street. These
walls of opus quadratum were built with a purpose, to be
sure, but their entire meaning has not been understood.<a
 name="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42"><sup>[42]</sup></a></p>
<p>The upper wall, the one along the Corso, can not be traced
farther than the Piazza Garibaldi, in front of the Cathedral.
It has been a mistake to consider this a high wall. It was
built simply to level up with the Corso terrace, partly to give
more space on the terrace, partly to make room for a road
which ran across the city here between two gates no longer
in existence. But more especially was it built to be the
lower support for a gigantic water reservoir which extends
under nearly the whole width of this terrace from about
Corso Pierluigi No. 88 almost to the Cathedral.<a name="FNanchor_43"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_43"><sup>[43]</sup></a> The four
sides of this great reservoir are also of opus quadratum laid
header and stretcher.</p>
<p>The lower wall, the real town wall, is a wall only in appearance,
for it has but one thickness of blocks, set header
and stretcher in a mass of solid concrete.<a name="FNanchor_44"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_44"><sup>[44]</sup></a> This wall
makes very clear the impregnability of even the lower
part of Pr&aelig;neste, for the wall not only occupies a good
position, but is really a double line of defense. There are
here two walls, one above the other, the upper one nineteen
feet back of the lower, thus leaving a terrace of that width.<a
 name="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45"><sup>[45]</sup></a>
At the east, instead of the lower solid wall of opus quadratum,
there is a series of fine tufa arches built to serve as a
substructure for something. It is to be remembered again
that between the arches on the east and the solid wall on the
west is a stretch of 200 feet of opus incertum, and a space
where there is no wall at all. This lower wall of Pr&aelig;neste
occupies the same line as the ancient wall and escarpment,
but the most of what survives was restored in Sulla's time.
The opus quadratum is exactly the same style as that in
the Tabularium in Rome.</p>
<p>Now, no one could see the width of the terrace above the
lower wall, without thinking that so great a width was unnecessary
unless it was to give room for a road.<a name="FNanchor_46"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_46"><sup>[46]</sup></a> The
difficulty has been, however, that the line of arches at the
east, not being in alignment with the lower wall on the west,
has not been connected with it hitherto, and so a correct
understanding of their relation has been impossible.</p>
<p>Before adducing evidence to show the location of the
main and triumphal entrance to Pr&aelig;neste, we shall turn
to the town above for a moment to see whether it is,
a priori, reasonable to suppose that there was an entrance
to the city here in the center of its front wall. If roads
came up a grade from the east and west, they would
join at a point where now there is no wall at all. This
break is in the center of the south wall, just above the
forum which was laid out in Sulla's time on the level spot
immediately below the town. Most worthy of note, however,
is that this opening is straight below the main buildings
<a name="page_30"></a>of the ancient town, the basilica, which is now
the cathedral,
and the temple of Fortuna. But further, a fact which
has never been noticed nor accounted for, this opening
is also in front of the modern square, the piazza
Garibaldi, which is in front of the buildings just
mentioned but below them on the next terrace, yet
there is no entrance to this terrace shown.<a name="FNanchor_47"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_47"><sup>[47]</sup></a> It is
well known that the open space south of the temple,
beside the basilica, has an ancient pavement some ten feet
below the present level of the modern piazza Savoia.<a
 name="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48"><sup>[48]</sup></a>
Proof given below in connection with the large tufa base
which is on the level of the lower terrace will show that the
piazza Garibaldi was an open space in ancient times and a
part of the ancient forum. Again, the solarium, which is
on the south face of the basilica,<a name="FNanchor_49"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_49"><sup>[49]</sup></a> was put up there that
it might be seen, and as it faces the south, the piazza Garibaldi,
and this open space in the wall under discussion,
what is more likely than that there was not only an open
square below the basilica, but also the main approach to
the city?</p>
<p>But now for the proof. In 1756 ancient paving stones
were still in situ<a name="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50"><sup>[50]</sup></a>
above the row of arches on the Via degli
Arconi, and even yet the ascent is plain enough to the eye.
The ground slopes up rather moderately along the Via
degli Arconi toward the east, and nearly below the southeast
corner of the ancient wall turned up to the west on
these arches, approaching the entrance in the middle of the
south wall of the city.<a name="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51"><sup>[51]</sup></a>
But these arches and the road on
them do not align exactly with the terrace on the west. Nor
should they do so. The arches are older than the present
opus quadratum wall, and the road swung round and up to
align with the road below and the old wall or escarpment of
the city above. Then when the whole town, its gates, its
walls, and its temple, were enlarged and repaired by Sulla,
the upper wall was perfectly aligned, a lower wall built on
the west leaving a terrace for a road, and the arches were
left to uphold the road on the east. Although the arches
were not exactly in line, the road could well have been so, for
the terrace here was wider and ran back to the upper wall.<a
 name="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52"><sup>[52]</sup></a>
The evidence is also positive enough that there was an
ascent to the terrace on the west, the one below the Barberini
gardens, which corresponds to the ascent on the arches.
This terrace now is level, and at its west end is some twenty
feet above the garden below. But the wall shows very
plainly that it had sloped off toward the west, and the slope
is most clearly to be seen, where a very obtuse angle of
newer and different tufa has been laid to build up the wall
to a level.<a name="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53"><sup>[53]</sup></a>
It is to be noticed too that this terrace is the
same height as the top of the ascent above the arches.
We have then actual proofs for roads leading up from
east and west toward the center of the wall on the south side
of the city, and every reason that an entrance here was practicable,
credible, and necessary.</p>
<p>But there is one thing more necessary to make probabilities
tally wholly with the facts. If there was a grand
entrance to the city, below the basilica, the temple, and the
main open square, which faced out over the great forum
below, there must have been a monumental gate in the wall.
As a matter of fact there was such a gate, and I believe it
was called the <a name="PORTA_TRIUMPHALIS"></a>PORTA TRIUMPHALIS. An
inscription of the
age of the Antonines mentions "seminaria a Porta Triumphale,"
and this passing reference to a gate with a name
which in itself implies a gate of consequence, so well known
that a building placed near it at once had its location fixed,
gives the rest of the proof necessary to establish a central
entrance to the city in front, through a PORTA TRIUMPHALIS.<a
 name="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54"><sup>[54]</sup></a></p>
<p>Before the time of Sulla there had been a gate in the
south wall of the city, approached by one road, which
ascended from the east on the arches facing the present
Via degli Arconi. After entering the city one went straight
up a grade not very steep to the basilica, and to the open
square or ancient forum which was the space now occupied
by the two modern piazzas, the Garibaldi and the Savoia,
and on still farther to the temple. When Sulla rebuilt
the city, and laid out a forum on the level
space directly south of and below the town, he made
another road from the west to correspond to the old ascent
from the east, and brought them together at the old central
gate, which he enlarged to the PORTA TRIUMPHALIS. In
the open square in front of the basilica had stood the
statue of some famous man<a name="FNanchor_55"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_55"><sup>[55]</sup></a> on a platform of squared stone
16 x 17-1/2 feet in measurement. Around this base the Sullan
improvements put a restraining wall of opus quadratum.<a
 name="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56"><sup>[56]</sup></a>
The open square was in front of the basilica and to its left
below the temple. There was but one way to the terrace
above the temple from the ancient forum. This was a steep
road to the right, up the present Via delle Scalette. Another
road ran to the left back of the basilica, but ended
either in front of the western cave connected with the temple,
or at the entrance into the precinct of the temple.</p>
<br />
<p><a name="GATES"></a>THE GATES.</p>
<p>Strabo, in a well known passage,<a name="FNanchor_57"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_57"><sup>[57]</sup></a> speaks of Tibur and
Pr&aelig;neste as two of the most famous and best fortified of
the towns of Latium, and tells why Pr&aelig;neste is the more
impregnable, but we have no mention of its gates in literature,
except incidentally in Plutarch,<a name="FNanchor_58"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_58"><sup>[58]</sup></a> who says that when
Marius was flying before Sulla's forces and had reached
Pr&aelig;neste, he found the gates closed, and had to be drawn
up the wall by a rope. The most ancient reference we
have to a definite gate is to the Porta Triumphalis, in the
inscription just mentioned, and this is the only gate of
Pr&aelig;neste mentioned by name in classic times.</p>
<p>In 1353 A.D. we have two gates mentioned. The
Roman tribune Cola di Rienzo (Niccola di Lorenzo)
brought his forces out to attack Stefaniello Colonna in
Pr&aelig;neste. It was not until Rienzo moved his camp across
from the west to the east side of the plain below the town
that he saw how the citizens were obtaining supplies. The
two gates S. Cesareo and S. Francesco<a name="FNanchor_59"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_59"><sup>[59]</sup></a> were both being
utilized to bring in supplies from the mountains back of the
city, and the stock was driven to and from pasture through
these gates. These gates were both ancient, as will be
shown below. Again in 1448 when Stefano Colonna
rebuilt some walls after the awful destruction of the
city by Cardinal Vitelleschi, he opened three gates, S.
Cesareo, del Murozzo, and del Truglio.<a name="FNanchor_60"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_60"><sup>[60]</sup></a> In 1642<a name="FNanchor_61"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_61"><sup>[61]</sup></a>
two more gates were opened by Prince Taddeo Barberini,
the Porta del Sole, and the Porta delle Monache,
the former at the southeast corner of the town, the latter
in the east wall at the point where the new wall round the
monastery della Madonna degl'Angeli struck the old city
wall, just above the present street where it turns from the
Via di Porta del Sole into the Corso Pierluigi. This
Porta del Sole<a name="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62"><sup>[62]</sup></a>
was the principal gate of the town at
this time, or perhaps the one most easily defended, for
in 1656, during the plague in Rome, all the other gates were
walled up, and this one alone left open.<a name="FNanchor_63"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_63"><sup>[63]</sup></a></p>
<p>The present gates of the city are: one, at the southeast
corner, the Porta del Sole; two, near the southwest corner,
where the wall turns up toward S. Martino, a gate now
closed;<a name="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64"><sup>[64]</sup></a>
three, Porta S. Martino, at the southwest corner
of the town; on the west side of the city, none at all; four,
Porta S. Francesco at the northwest corner of the city
proper; five, a gate in the arx wall, now closed,<a name="FNanchor_65"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_65"><sup>[65]</sup></a> beside
the medi&aelig;val gate, which is just at the head of the depression
shown in plate III, the lowest point in the wall of the
citadel; on the east, Porta S. Cesareo, some distance above
the town, six; seven, Porta dei Cappuccini, which is on the
same terrace as Porta S. Francesco; eight, Portella, the
eastern outlet of the Via della Portella; nine, a postern
just below the Portella, and not now in use;<a name="FNanchor_66"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_66"><sup>[66]</sup></a> ten, Porta
delle Monache or Santa Maria, in front of the church of that
name. The most ancient of these, and the ones which were
in the earliest circle of the cyclopean wall, are five in number:
Porta S. Francesco,<a name="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67"><sup>[67]</sup></a>
the gate into the arx, Porta S.
Cesareo,<a name="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68"><sup>[68]</sup></a>
Porta dei Cappuccini, and the postern at the corner
where the early cyclopean cross wall struck the main
wall.</p>
<p>The second wall of the city, which was rather an
enlargement of the first, was cyclopean on the east
as far as the present Porta del Sole, and either scarped
cliff or opus quadratum round to Porta S. Martino,
and up to Porta S. Francesco.<a name="FNanchor_69"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_69"><sup>[69]</sup></a> At the east end
of the modern Corso, there was a gate, made of
opus quadratum,<a name="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70"><sup>[70]</sup></a>
as is shown not only by the fact
that this is the main street of the city, and on the terrace
level of the basilica, but also because the medi&aelig;val wall
round the monastery of the Madonna degl'Angeli, the
grounds of the present church of Santa Maria, did not run
straight to the cyclopean wall, but turned down to join it
near the gate which it helps to prove. Next, there was
a gate, but in all probability only a postern, near the Porta
del Sole where the cyclopean wall stops, where now there
is a narrow street which runs up to the piazza Garibaldi.
On the south there was the gate which at some time was
given the name Porta Triumphalis. It was at the place
where now there is no wall at all.<a name="FNanchor_71"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_71"><sup>[71]</sup></a> At the southwest
we find the next gate, the one which is now closed.<a name="FNanchor_72"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_72"><sup>[72]</sup></a>
The last one of the ancient gates in this second circle of
the city wall was one just inside the modern Porta S. Martino,
which opened west at the end of the Corso. All the
rest of the gates are medi&aelig;val.</p>
<p>A few words about the roads leading to the several gates
of Pr&aelig;neste will help further to settle the antiquity of these
gates.<a name="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73"><sup>[73]</sup></a>
The oldest road was certainly the trade route which
came up the north side of the Liris valley below the hill on
which Pr&aelig;neste was situated, and which followed about the
line of the Via Pr&aelig;nestina as shown by Ashby in his map.<a
 name="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74"><sup>[74]</sup></a>
Two branch roads from this main track ran up to the
town, one at the west, the other at the east, both in the
same line as the modern roads. These roads were bound
for the city gates as a matter of course and the land slopes
least sharply where these roads were and still are. Another
important road was outside the city wall, from one
gate to the other, and took the slope on the south side of
the city where the Via degli Arconi now runs.<a name="FNanchor_75"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_75"><sup>[75]</sup></a></p>
<p>As far as excavations have proved up to this time, the
oldest road out of Pr&aelig;neste is that which is now the Via
della Marcigliana, along which were found the very early
tombs. It is to be noted that these tombs begin beyond the
church of S. Rocco, which is a long distance below the
town. This distance however makes it certain that between
S. Rocco and the city, excavation will bring to light other
and yet older tombs along the road which leads up toward
"l'antica porta S. Martino chiusa," and also in all probability
rows of graves will be found along the present road
to Cave. But the tombs give us the direction at least of
the old road.<a name="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76"><sup>[76]</sup></a></p>
<p>There is yet another old road which was lately discovered.
It is about three hundred yards below the city and near the
road that cuts through from Porta del Sole to the church
of Madonna dell'Aquila.<a name="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77"><sup>[77]</sup></a>
This road is made of polygonal
stones of the limestone of the mountain, and hence is older
than any of the lava roads. It runs nearly parallel with
the Via degli Arconi, and takes a direction which would
strike the Via Pr&aelig;nestina where it crosses the Via
Pr&aelig;nestina
Nuova which runs past Zagarolo. That is, the most
ancient piece of road we have leads up to the southeast
corner of the town, but the oldest tombs point to a road
the direction of which was toward the southwest corner.
However, all the roads lead toward the southeast corner,
where the old grade began that went up above the arches,
mentioned above, to a middle gate of the city.</p>
<p>The gate S. Francesco also is proved to be ancient because
of the old road that led from it. This road is identified
by a deposit of ex voto terracottas which were found
at the edge of the road in a hole hollowed out in the rocks.<a
 name="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78"><sup>[78]</sup></a></p>
<p>The two roads which were traveled the most were the
ones that led toward Rome. This is shown by the tombs on
both sides of them,<a name="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79"><sup>[79]</sup></a>
and by the discovery of a deposit
of a great quantity of ex voto terracottas in the angle between
the two.<a name="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80"><sup>[80]</sup></a></p>
<br />
<p><a name="WATER"></a>THE WATER SUPPLY OF PR&AElig;NESTE.</p>
<p>In very early times there was a spring near the top of
Monte Glicestro. This is shown by a glance back at plate
III, which indicates the depression or cut in the hill, which
from its shape and depth is clearly not altogether natural
and attributable to the effects of rain, but is certainly the
effect of a spring, the further and positive proof of the
existence of which is shown by the unnecessarily low dip
made by the wall of the citadel purposely to inclose the
head of this depression. There are besides no water reservoirs
inside the wall of the arx. This supply of water,
however, failed, and it must have failed rather early in the
city's history, perhaps at about the time the lower part of
the city was walled in, for the great reservoir on the Corso
terrace seems to be contemporary with this second wall.</p>
<p>But at all times Pr&aelig;neste was dependent upon reservoirs
for a sure and lasting supply of water. The mountain and
the town were famous because of the number of water
reservoirs there.<a name="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81"><sup>[81]</sup></a>A
great many of these reservoirs were
dependent upon catchings from the rain,<a name="FNanchor_82"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_82"><sup>[82]</sup></a> but
before a war,
or when the rainfall was scant, they were filled undoubtedly
from springs outside the city. In later times they were
connected with the aqueducts which came to the city from
beyond Capranica.</p>
<p>It is easy to account now for the number of gates on the
east side of the city. True, this side of the wall lay away
from the Campagna, and egress from gates on this side
could not be seen by an enemy unless he moved clear across
the front of the city.<a name="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83"><sup>[83]</sup></a>
But the real reason for the presence
of so many gates is that the best and most copious
springs were on this side of the city, as well as the course
of the little headstream of the Trerus. The best concealed
egress was from the Porta Cesareo, from which a road led
round back of the mountain to a fine spring, which was
high enough above the valley to be quite safe.</p>
<p>There are no references in literature to aqueducts which
brought water to Pr&aelig;neste. Were we left to this evidence
alone, we should conclude that Pr&aelig;neste had depended upon
reservoirs for water. But in inscriptions we have mention
of baths,<a name="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84"><sup>[84]</sup></a>
the existence of which implies aqueducts, and
there is the specus of an aqueduct to be seen outside the
Porta S. Francesco.<a name="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85"><sup>[85]</sup></a>
This ran across to the Colle S. Martino
to supply a large brick reservoir of imperial date.<a name="FNanchor_86"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_86"><sup>[86]</sup></a>
There were aqueducts still in 1437, for Cardinal Vitelleschi
captured Palestrina by cutting off its water supply.<a
 name="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87"><sup>[87]</sup></a> This
shows that the water came from outside the city, and
through aqueducts which probably dated back to Roman
times,<a name="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88"><sup>[88]</sup></a>
and also that the reservoirs were at this time no
longer used. In 1581 the city undertook to restore the old
aqueduct which brought water from back of Capranica, but
no description was left of its exact course or ancient construction.<a
 name="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89"><sup>[89]</sup></a>
While these repairs were in progress, Francesco
Cecconi leased to the city his property called Terreni,
where there were thirty fine springs of clear water not far
from the city walls. Again in 1776 the springs called delle
cannuccete sent in dirty water to the city, so citizens were
appointed to remedy matters. They added a new spring to
those already in use and this water came to the city through
an aqueduct.<a name="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90"><sup>[90]</sup></a></p>
<p>The remains of four great reservoirs, all of brick construction,
are plainly enough to be seen at Palestrina, and
as far as situation and size are concerned, are well enough
described in other places.<a name="FNanchor_91"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_91"><sup>[91]</sup></a> But in the case of these
reservoirs,
as in that of all the other remains of ancient construction
at Pr&aelig;neste, the writers on the history of the
town have made great mistakes, because all of them
have been predisposed to the pleasant task of making all
the ruins fit some restoration or other of the temple of
Fortuna, although, as a matter of fact, none of the reservoirs
have any connection whatever with the temple.<a name="FNanchor_92"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_92"><sup>[92]</sup></a> <a name="page_41"></a>The
fine brick reservoir of the time of Tiberius,<a name="FNanchor_93"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_93"><sup>[93]</sup></a> which is at
the junction of the Via degli Arconi and the road from the
Porta S. Martino, was not built to supply fountains or
baths in the forum below, but was simply a great supply
reservoir for the citizens who lived in particular about the
lower forum, and the water from this reservoir was carried
away by hand, as is shown by the two openings like well
heads in the top of each compartment of the reservoir, and
by the steps which gave entrance to it on the east. The
reservoir above this in the Barberini gardens is of a date
a half century later.<a name="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94"><sup>[94]</sup></a>
It is of the same brick work as
the great fountain which stands, now debased to a grist
mill, across the Via degli Arconi about half way between
S. Lucia and Porta del Sole. The upper reservoir undoubtedly
supplied this fountain, and other public buildings in
the forum below. There is another large brick reservoir
below the present ground level in the angle between the
Via degli Arconi and the Cave road below the Porta del
Sole, but it is too low ever to have served for public use.
It was in connection with some private bath. The fourth
huge reservoir, the one on Colle S. Martino, has already
been mentioned.</p>
<p>But the most ancient of all the reservoirs is one which
is not mentioned anywhere. It dates from the time when
the Corso terrace was made, and is of opus quadratum like
the best of the wall below the city, and the wall on the
lower side of the terrace.<a name="FNanchor_95"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_95"><sup>[95]</sup></a> This reservoir, like the one
in
the Barberini garden, served the double purpose of a storage
for water, and of a foundation for the terrace, which, being
thus widened, offered more space for street and buildings
above. It lies west of the basilica, but has no connection
with the temple. From its position it seems rather to have
been one of the secret public water supplies.<a name="FNanchor_96"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_96"><sup>[96]</sup></a></p>
<p>Pr&aelig;neste had in early times only one spring within the
city walls, just inside the gate leading into the arx. There
were other springs on the mountain to the east and northeast,
but too far away to be included within the walls. Because
of their height above the valley, they were to a certain
extent available even in times of warfare and siege.
As the upper spring dried up early, and the others were
a little precarious, an elaborate system of reservoirs was developed,
a plan which the natural terraces of the mountain
slope invited, and a plan which gave more space to the town
itself with the work of leveling necessary for the reservoirs.
These reservoirs were all public property. They were at
first dependent upon collection from rains or from spring
water carried in from outside the city walls. Later, however,
aqueducts were made and connected with the reservoirs.</p>
<p>With the expansion of the town to the plain below, this
system gave great opportunity for the development of baths,
fountains, and waterworks,<a name="FNanchor_97"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_97"><sup>[97]</sup></a> for Pr&aelig;neste wished to
vie
with Tibur and Rome, where the Anio river and the many
aqueducts had made possible great things for public use
and municipal adornment.</p>
<br />
<p><a name="TEMPLE"></a>THE TEMPLE OF FORTUNA PRIMIGENIA.</p>
<p>Nusquam se fortunatiorem quam Pr&aelig;neste vidisse Fortunam.<a
 name="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98"><sup>[98]</sup></a>
In this way Cicero reports a popular saying
which makes clear the fame of the goddess Fortuna Primigenia
and her temple at Pr&aelig;neste.<a name="FNanchor_99"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_99"><sup>[99]</sup></a></p>
<p>The excavations at Pr&aelig;neste in the eighteenth century
brought the city again into prominence, and from that time
to the present, Pr&aelig;neste has offered much material for
arch&aelig;ologists and historians.</p>
<p>But the temple of Fortuna has constituted the principal
interest and engaged the particular attention of everyone
who has worked upon the history of the town, because the
early enthusiastic view was that the temple occupied the
whole slope of the mountain,<a name="FNanchor_100"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_100"><sup>[100]</sup></a> and that the present city
was built on the terraces and in the ruins of the temple.
Every successive study, however, of the city from a topographical
point of view has lessened more and more the
estimated size of the temple, until now all that can be maintained
successfully is that there are two separate temples
built at different times, the later and larger one occupying
a position two terraces higher than the older and more important
temple below.</p>
<p>The lower temple with its precinct, along the north side
of which extends a wall and the ruins of a so-called cryptoporticus
which connected two caves hollowed out in the
rock, is not so very large a sanctuary, but it occupies a very
good position above and behind the ancient forum and basilica
on a terrace cut back into the solid rock of the mountain.
The temple precinct is a courtyard which extends
along the terrace and occupies its whole width from the
older cave on the west to the newer one at the east. In
front of the latter cave is built the temple itself, which faces
west along the terrace, but extends its southern facade to the
edge of the ancient forum which it overlooks. This temple
is older than the time of Sulla, and occupies the site of an
earlier temple.</p>
<p>Two terraces higher, on the Cortina terrace, stretch out
the ruins of a huge construction in opus incertum. This
building had at least two stories of colonnade facing the
south, and at the north side of the terrace a series of arches
above which in the center rose a round temple which was
approached by a semicircular flight of steps.<a name="FNanchor_101"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_101"><sup>[101]</sup></a> This building,
belonging to the time of Sulla, presented a very imposing
appearance from the forum below the town. It has no
connection with the lower temple unless perhaps by underground
passages.</p>
<p>Although this new temple and complex of buildings was
much larger and costlier than the temple below, it was so
little able to compete with the fame of the ancient shrine,
that until medi&aelig;val times there is not a mention of it anywhere
by name or by suggestion, unless perhaps in one
inscription mentioned below. The splendid publication of
Delbrueck<a name="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102"><sup>[102]</sup></a>
with maps and plans and bibliography of the
lower temple and the work which has been done on it, makes
unnecessary any remarks except on some few points which
have escaped him.</p>
<p>The tradition was that a certain Numerius Suffustius of
Pr&aelig;neste was warned in dreams to cut into the rocks at a
certain place, and this he did before his mocking fellow citizens,
when to the bewilderment of them all pieces of wood
inscribed with letters of the earliest style leaped from the
rock. The place where this phenomenon occurred was thus
proved divine, the cult of Fortuna Primigenia was established
beyond peradventure, and her oracular replies to those
who sought her shrine were transmitted by means of these
lettered blocks.<a name="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103"><sup>[103]</sup></a>
This story accounts for a cave in which
the lots (sortes) were to be consulted.</p>
<p>But there are two caves. The reason why there are two
has never been shown, nor does Delbrueck have proof
enough to settle which is the older cave.<a name="FNanchor_104"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_104"><sup>[104]</sup></a></p>
<p>The cave to the west is made by Delbrueck the shrine of
Iuppiter puer, and the temple with its cave at the east,
the &aelig;des Fortun&aelig;. This he does on the authority of his
understanding of the passage from Cicero which gives
nearly all the written information we have on the subject of
the temple.<a name="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105"><sup>[105]</sup></a>
Delbrueck bases his entire argument on this
passage and two other references to a building called &aelig;des.<a
 name="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106"><sup>[106]</sup></a>
Now it was Fortuna who was worshipped at Pr&aelig;neste,
and not Jupiter. Although there is an intimate connection
between Jupiter and Fortuna at Pr&aelig;neste, because she was
thought of at different times as now the mother and now
the daughter of Jupiter, still the weight of evidence will not
allow any such importance to be attached to Iuppiter puer
as Delbrueck wishes.<a name="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107"><sup>[107]</sup></a></p>
<p>The two caves were not made at the same time. This
is proved by the fact that the basilica<a name="FNanchor_108"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_108"><sup>[108]</sup></a> is below and between
them. Had there been two caves at the earliest time, with
a common precinct as a connection between them, as there
was later, there would have been power enough in the priesthood
to keep the basilica from occupying the front of the
place which would have been the natural spot for a temple
or for the imposing facade of a portico. The western cave
is the earlier, but it is the earlier not because it was a shrine
of Iuppiter puer, but because the ancient road which came
through the forum turned up to it, because it is the least
symmetrical of the two caves, and because the temple faced
it, and did not face the forum.</p>
<p>The various plans of the temple<a name="FNanchor_109"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_109"><sup>[109]</sup></a> have usually assumed
like buildings in front of each cave, and a building, corresponding
to the basilica, between them and forming an
integral part of the plan. But the basilica does not quite
align with the temple, and the road back of the basilica precludes
any such idea, not to mention the fact that no building
the size of a temple was in front of the west cave. It
is the mania for making the temple cover too large a space,
and the desire to show that all its parts were exactly balanced
on either side, and that this triangular shaped sanctuary
culminated in a round temple, this it is that has caused so
much trouble with the topography of the city. The temple,
as it really is, was larger perhaps than any other in Latium,
and certainly as imposing.</p>
<p>Delbrueck did not see that there was a real communication
between the caves along the so-called cryptoporticus. There
is a window-like hole, now walled up, in the east cave at
the top, and it opened out upon the second story of the
cryptoporticus, as Marucchi saw.<a name="FNanchor_110"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_110"><sup>[110]</sup></a> So there was an unseen
means of getting from one cave to the other. This
probably proves that suppliants at one shrine went to the
other and were there convinced of the power of the goddess
by seeing the same priest or something which they
themselves had offered at the first shrine. It certainly
proves that both caves were connected with the rites having
to do with the proper obtaining of lots from Fortuna,
and that this communication between the caves was
unknown to any but the temple servants.</p>
<p>There are some other inscriptions not noticed by Delbrueck
which mention the &aelig;des,<a name="FNanchor_111"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_111"><sup>[111]</sup></a> and bear on the question in
hand.
One inscription found in the Via delle Monache<a name="FNanchor_112"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_112"><sup>[112]</sup></a> shows
that in connection with the sedes Fortun&aelig; were a manceps
and three cellarii. This is an inscription of the last of the
second or the first of the third century A.D.,<a name="FNanchor_113"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_113"><sup>[113]</sup></a> when both
lower and upper temples were in very great favor. It shows
further that only the lower temple is meant, for the number
is too small to be applicable to the great upper temple, and
it also shows that &aelig;des, means the temple building itself
and not the whole precinct. There is also an inscription,
now in the floor of the cathedral, that mentions &aelig;des. Its
provenience is noteworthy.<a name="FNanchor_114"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_114"><sup>[114]</sup></a> There were other buildings,
however, belonging to the precinct of the lower temple, as
is shown by the remains today.<a name="FNanchor_115"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_115"><sup>[115]</sup></a> That there was more
than one sacred building is also shown by inscriptions which
mention &aelig;des sacr&aelig;,<a name="FNanchor_116"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_116"><sup>[116]</sup></a> though these may refer of
course
to the upper temple as well.</p>
<p>There are yet two inscriptions of importance, one of
which mentions a porticus, the other an &aelig;des et porticus.<a
 name="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117"><sup>[117]</sup></a>
The second of these inscriptions belongs to a time not much
later than the founding of the colony. It tells that certain
work was done by decree of the decuriones, and it can
hardly refer to the ancient lower temple, but must mean
either the upper one, or still another out on the new forum,
for there is where the stone is reported to have been found.
The first inscription records a work of some consequence
done by a woman in remembrance of her husband.<a name="FNanchor_118"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_118"><sup>[118]</sup></a>
There are no remains to show that the forum below the
town had any temple of such consequence, so it seems best
to refer both these inscriptions to the upper temple, which,
as we know, was rich in marble.<a name="FNanchor_119"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_119"><sup>[119]</sup></a></p>
<p>Now after having brought together all the usages of the
word &aelig;des in its application to the temple of Pr&aelig;neste, it
seems that Delbrueck has very small foundation for his
argument which assumes as settled the exact meaning and
location of the &aelig;des Fortun&aelig;.</p>
<p>From the temple itself we turn now to a brief discussion
of a space on the tufa wall which helps to face the cave
on the west. This is a smoothed surface which shows a
narrow cornice ledge above it, and a narrow base below.
In it are a number of irregularly driven holes. Delbrueck
calls it a votive niche,<a name="FNanchor_120"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_120"><sup>[120]</sup></a> and says that the "viele
regellos
verstreute Nagelloecher" are due to nails upon which votive
offerings were suspended.</p>
<p>This seems quite impossible. The holes are much too
irregular to have served such a purpose. The holes show
positively that they were made by nails which held up a
slab of some kind, perhaps of marble, on which were displayed
the replies from the goddess<a name="FNanchor_121"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_121"><sup>[121]</sup></a> which were too long
to be given by means of the lettered blocks (sortes). Most
likely, however, it was a marble slab or bronze tablet which
contained the lex templi, and was something like the tabula
Veliterna.<a name="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122"><sup>[122]</sup></a></p>
<p>On the floor of the two caves were two very beautiful
mosaics, one of which is now in the Barberini palace, the
other, which is in a sadly mutilated condition, still on the
floor of the west cave. The date of these mosaics has been
a much discussed question. Marucchi puts it at the end of
the second century A.D., while Delbrueck makes it the
early part of the first century B.C., and thinks the mosaics
were the gift of Sulla. Delbrueck does not make his point
at all, and Marucchi is carried too far by a desire to establish
a connection at Pr&aelig;neste between Fortuna and Isis.<a
 name="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123"><sup>[123]</sup></a>
Not to go into a discussion of the date of the Greek lettering
which gives the names of the animals portrayed in
the finer mosaic, nor the subject of the mosaic itself,<a
 name="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124"><sup>[124]</sup></a>
the
inscription given above<a href="#Footnote_118"><sup>[118]</sup></a>
should help to settle the
date of
the mosaic. Under Claudius, between the years 51 and 54
A.D., a portico was decorated with marble and a coating
of marble facing. That this was a very splendid ornamentation
is shown by the fact that it is mentioned so particularly
in the inscription. And if in 54 A.D. marble and
marble facing were things so worthy of note, then certainly
one hundred and thirty years earlier there was no marble
mosaic floor in Pr&aelig;neste like the one under discussion,
which is considered the finest large piece of Roman mosaic
in existence. And it was fifty years later than the date
Delbrueck wishes to assign to this mosaic, before marble
began to be used in any great profusion in Rome, and at
this time Pr&aelig;neste was not in advance of Rome. The mosaic,
therefore, undoubtedly dates from about the time of
Hadrian, and was probably a gift to the city when he built
himself a villa below the town.<a name="FNanchor_125"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_125"><sup>[125]</sup></a></p>
<p>Finally, a word with regard to the &aelig;rarium. This is under
the temple of Fortuna, but is not built with any regard
to the facade of the temple above. The inscription on the
back wall of the chamber is earlier than the time of Sulla,<a
 name="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126"><sup>[126]</sup></a>
and <a name="page_51"></a>the position of this little vault<a
 name="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127"><sup>[127]</sup></a>
shows that it was a
treasury connected with the basilica, indeed its close proximity
about makes it part of that building and proves that
it was the storehouse for public funds and records. It
occupied a very prominent place, for it was at the upper
end of the old forum, directly in front of the Sacra Via
that came up past the basilica from the Porta Triumphalis.
The conclusion of the whole matter is that the earliest
city forum grew up on the terrace in front of the place
where the mysterious lots had leaped out of the living rock.
A basilica was built in a prominent place in the northwest
corner of the forum. Later, another wonderful cave was
discovered or made, and at such a distance from the first
one that a temple in front of it would have a facing on the
forum beyond the basilica, and this also gave a space of
ground which was leveled off into a terrace above the basilica
and the forum, and made into a sacred precinct.
Because the basilica occupied the middle front of the
temple property, the temple was made to face west along
the terrace, toward the more ancient cave. The sacred precinct
in front of the temple and between the caves was enclosed,
and had no entrance except at the west end where
the Sacra Via ended, which was in front of the west cave.
Before the temple, facing the sacred inclosure was the
pronaos mentioned in the inscription above,<a name="FNanchor_128"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_128"><sup>[128]</sup></a> and along
each side of this inclosure ran a row of columns, and probably
one also on the west side. Both caves and the temple
were consecrated to the service of Fortuna Primigenia, the
tutelary goddess of Pr&aelig;neste. Both caves and an earlier
temple, which occupied part of the site of the present one,
belong to the early life of Pr&aelig;neste.</p>
<p>Sulla built a huge temple on the second terrace higher
than the old temple, but its fame and sanctity were never
comparable to its beauty and its pretensions.<a name="FNanchor_129"></a><a

on page 41 must have belonged also to a bath, and so do
the ruins which are out beyond the villa under which the

seem to belong to the villa. There were also baths on

<p>Cecconi thought there was a circus at the bottom of
the depression between Colle S. Martino and the hill of
Pr&aelig;neste. The depression does have a suspiciously
rounded appearance below the Franciscan grounds, but a
careful examination made by me shows no trace of cutting
in the rock to make a half circle for seats, no traces
of any use of the slope for seats, and no ruins of any
kind.</p>
<br />
<p>CULINA, C.I.L., XIV, 3002.</p>
<p>This was a building of some consequence. Two
qu&aelig;stors of the city bought a space of ground 148-1/2 by
16 feet along the wall, and superintended the building of
a culina there. The ground was made public, and the
whole transaction was done by decree of the senate, that
is, it was done before the time of Sulla.</p>

<p>CURIA, C.I.L., XIV, 2924.</p>
<p>The fact that a statue was to be set up (ve)l ante
curiam vel in porticibus for(i) would seem to imply that
the curia was in the lower Forum. The inscription shows
that these two places were undoubtedly the most desirable
places that a statue could have. There is a possibility
that the curia may be the basilica on the Corso terrace
of the city. It has been shown that an open space existed
in front of the basilica, and that in it there is at
least one basis for a statue. Excavations<a name="FNanchor_136"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_136"><sup>[136]</sup></a> at the ruins
which were once thought to be the curia of ancient Pr&aelig;neste
showed instead of a hemicycle, a straight wall built
on remains of a more ancient construction of rectangular
blocks of tufa with three layers of pavement 4-1/2 feet
below the level of the ground, under which was a tomb
of brick construction, and lower still a wall of opus quadratum
of tufa, certainly none of the remains belonging
to a curia.</p>

<p><a name="FORUM"></a>FORUM, C.I.L., XIV, 3015.</p>
<p>The most ancient forum of Pr&aelig;neste was inside the
city walls. It was in this forum that the statue of M.
Anicius, the famous pr&aelig;tor, was set up.<a name="FNanchor_137"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_137"><sup>[137]</sup></a> The writers
hitherto, however, have been entirely mistaken, in
my opinion, as to the extent of the ancient forum.
For the old forum was not an open space which is now
represented by the Piazza Savoia of the modern town, as
is generally accepted, but the ancient forum of Pr&aelig;neste
was that piazza and the piazza Garibaldi and the space
between them, now built over with houses, all combined.
At the present time one goes down some steps in front
of the cathedral, which was the basilica, to the Piazza
Garibaldi, and it has been supposed that this open space
belonged to a terrace below the Corso. But there was no
lower terrace there. The upper part of the forum simply
has been more deeply buried in debris than the lower part.</p>
<p>One needs only to see the new excavations at the upper
end of the Piazza Savoia to realize that the present ground
level of the piazza is nearly nine feet higher than the
pavement of the old forum. The accompanying illustration
(<a href="#plate_iv">plate IV</a>) shows the pavement, which is
limestone,
not lava, that comes up the slope along the east
side of the basilica,<a name="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138"><sup>[138]</sup></a>
and turns round it to the west.
A cippus stands at the corner to do the double duty
of defining the limits of the basilica, and to keep
the wheels of wagons from running up on the steps.
It can be seen clearly that the lowest step is one stone
short of the cippus, that the next step is on a level with
the pavement at the cippus, and the next step level again
with the pavement four feet beyond it. The same
grade would give us about twelve or fifteen steps
at the south end of the basilica, and if continued to the
Piazza Garibaldi, would put us below the present level
of that piazza. From this piazza on down through the
garden of the Petrini family to the point where the existence
of a Porta Triumphalis has been proved, the grade
would not be even as steep as it was in the forum itself.
Further, to show that the lower piazza is even yet accessible
from the upper, despite its nine feet more of
fill, if one goes to the east end of the Piazza Savoia he
finds there instead of steps, as before the basilica, a street
which leads down to the level of the Piazza Garibaldi,
and although it begins at the present level of the upper
piazza, it is not even now too steep for wagons.
Again, one must remember that the opus quadratum wall
which extends along the south side of the Corso does
not go past the basilica, and also that there is a basis for
a statue of some kind in front of the basilica on the level
of the Piazza Garibaldi.</p>
<p>It is a question whether the ancient forum was entirely
paved. The paving can be seen along the basilica, and
it has been seen back of it,<a name="FNanchor_139"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_139"><sup>[139]</sup></a> but this pavement belongs
to another hitherto unknown part of Pr&aelig;nestine topography,
namely, a SACRA VIA. An inscription to an aurufex
de sacra via<a name="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140"><sup>[140]</sup></a>
makes certain that there was a
road in Pr&aelig;neste to which this name was given. The
inscription was found in the courtyard of the Seminary,
which was the precinct of the temple of Fortuna.
From the fact that this pavement is laid with blocks
such as are always used in roads, from the cippus at the
corner of the basilica to keep off wagon wheels, from the
fact that this piece of pavement is in direct line from
the central gate of the town, and last from the inscription
and its provenience, I conclude that we have in this pavement
a road leading directly from the Porta Triumphalis
through the forum, alongside the basilica, then turning
back of it and continuing round to the delubra and
precinct of the temple of Fortuna Primigenia, and that
this road is the SACRA VIA of Pr&aelig;neste.<a name="FNanchor_141"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_141"><sup>[141]</sup></a></p>
<p>At the upper end of the forum under the south fa&ccedil;ade
of the temple, an excavation was made in April 1907,<a
 name="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142"><sup>[142]</sup></a>
which is of great interest and importance in connection
with the forum. In Plate V we see that there are three
steps of tufa,<a name="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143"><sup>[143]</sup></a>
and observe that the space in front
of them is not paved; also that the ascent to the
right, which is the only way out of the forum at
this corner, is too steep to have been ever more than for
ascent on foot. But it is up this steep and narrow way<a
 name="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144"><sup>[144]</sup></a>
that every one had to go to reach the terrace above the
temple, unless he went across to the west side of the city.</p>
<p>The steps just mentioned are not the beginning of an
ascent to the temple, for there were but three, and besides
there was no entrance to the temple on the south.<a name="FNanchor_145"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_145"><sup>[145]</sup></a>
Nor was the earlier temple much lower than the later
one, for in either case the foundation was the rock
surface of the terrace and has not changed much.
Although these steps are of an older construction than
the steps of the basilica, yet they were not covered up in
late imperial times as is shown by the brick construction in
the plate. One is tempted to believe that there was a
Doric portico below the engaged Corinthian columns of
the south fa&ccedil;ade of the temple.<a name="FNanchor_146"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_146"><sup>[146]</sup></a> But all the pieces
of Doric columns found belong to the portico of the
basilica. Otherwise one might try to set up further
argument for a portico, and even claim that here was the
place that the statue was set up, ante curiam vel in por
ticibus fori.<a name="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147"><sup>[147]</sup></a>
Again, these steps run far past the temple
to the east, otherwise we might conclude that they
were to mark the extent of temple property. The fact,
however, that a road, the Sacra Via, goes round back
of the basilica only to the left, forces us to conclude that
these steps belong to the city, not to the temple in any
way, and that they mark the north side of the ancient
forum.</p>
<p>The new forum below the city is well enough attested
by inscriptions found there mentioning statues and buildings
in the forum. The tradition has continued that here
on the level space below the town was the great forum.
Inscriptions which have been found in different places
on this tract of ground mention five buildings,<a name="FNanchor_148"></a><a

<p>IUNONARIUM, C.I.L., XIV, 2867.</p>
<p>Delbrueck follows Preller<a name="FNanchor_154"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_154"><sup>[154]</sup></a> in making the Iunonarium
a part of the temple of Fortuna. It seems strange to have
a statue of Trivia dedicated in a Iunonarium, but it is
stranger that there are no inscriptions among those from
Pr&aelig;neste which mention Juno, except that the name alone
appears on a bronze mirror and two bronze dishes,<a name="FNanchor_155"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_155"><sup>[155]</sup></a> and
as the provenience of bronze is never certain, such inscriptions
mean nothing. It seems that the Iunonarium
must have been somewhere in the west end of the temple
precinct of Fortuna.</p>

<p>KASA CUI VOCABULUM EST FULGERITA, C.I.L., XIV, 2934.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<h2>THE MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT OF PR&AElig;NESTE.</h2>
<br />
<p>Pr&aelig;neste was already a rich and prosperous community,
when Rome was still fighting for a precarious existence.
The rapid development, however, of the Latin towns, and
the necessity of mutual protection and advancement soon
brought Rome and Pr&aelig;neste into a league with the other
towns of Latium. Pr&aelig;neste because of her position and
wealth was the haughtiest member of the newly made confederation,
and with the more rapid growth of Rome became
her most hated rival. Later, when Rome passed from
a position of first among equals to that of mistress of her
former allies, Pr&aelig;neste was her proudest and most turbulent
subject.</p>
<p>From the earliest times, when the overland trade between
Upper Etruria, Magna Gr&aelig;cia, and Lower Etruria came up
the Liris valley, and touching Pr&aelig;neste and Tibur crossed
the river Tiber miles above Rome, that energetic little settlement
looked with longing on the city that commanded
the splendid valley between the Sabine and Volscian mountains.
Rome turned her conquests in the direction of her
longings, but could get no further than Gabii. Pr&aelig;neste
and Tibur were too strongly situated, and too closely connected
with the fierce mountaineers of the interior,<a name="FNanchor_158"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_158"><sup>[158]</sup></a> and
Rome was glad to make treaties with them on equal terms.</p>
<p>Rome, however, made the most of her opportunities.
Her trade up and down the river increased, and at the same
time brought her in touch with other nations more and more.
Her political importance grew rapidly, and it was not long
before she began to assume the primacy among the towns
of the Latin league. This assumption of a leadership practically
hers already was disputed by only one city. This
was Pr&aelig;neste, and there can be no doubt but that if
Pr&aelig;neste
had possessed anything approaching the same commercial
facilities in way of communication by water she
would have been Rome's greatest rival. As late as 374
B.C. Pr&aelig;neste was alone an opponent worthy of Rome.<a
 name="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159"><sup>[159]</sup></a></p>
<p>As head of a league of nine cities,<a name="FNanchor_160"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_160"><sup>[160]</sup></a> and allied with Tibur,
which also headed a small confederacy,<a name="FNanchor_161"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_161"><sup>[161]</sup></a> Pr&aelig;neste felt herself
strong enough to defy the other cities of the league,<a
 name="FNanchor_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162"><sup>[162]</sup></a>
and in fact even to play fast and loose with Rome, as Rome
kept or transgressed the stipulations of their agreements.
Rome, however, took advantage of Pr&aelig;neste at every opportunity.
She assumed control of some of her land in
338 B.C., on the ground that Pr&aelig;neste helped the Gauls in
390;<a name="FNanchor_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163"><sup>[163]</sup></a>
she showed her jealousy of Pr&aelig;neste by refusing to
allow Quintus Lutatius Cerco to consult the lots there during
the first Punic war.<a name="FNanchor_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164"><sup>[164]</sup></a>
This jealousy manifested itself
again in the way the leader of a contingent from Pr&aelig;neste
was treated by a Roman dictator<a name="FNanchor_165"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_165"><sup>[165]</sup></a> in 319 B.C. But
while these isolated outbursts of jealousy showed the ill
feeling of Rome toward Pr&aelig;neste, there is yet a stronger
evidence of the fact that Pr&aelig;neste had been in early times
more than Rome's equal, for through the entire subsequent
history of the aggrandizement of Rome at the expense of
every other town in the Latin League, there runs a bitterness
which finds expression in the slurs cast upon Pr&aelig;neste,
an ever-recurring reminder of the centuries of ancient
grudge. Often in Roman literature Pr&aelig;neste is mentioned
as the typical country town. Her inhabitants are laughed
at because of their bad pronunciation, despised and pitied
because of their characteristic combination of pride and rusticity.
Yet despite the dwindling fortunes of the town she
was able to keep a treaty with Rome on nearly equal terms
until 90 B.C., the year in which the Julian law was passed.<a
 name="FNanchor_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166"><sup>[166]</sup></a>
Pr&aelig;neste scornfully refused Roman citizenship in 216
B.C., when it was offered.<a name="FNanchor_167"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_167"><sup>[167]</sup></a> This refusal Rome never
forgot
nor forgave. No Pr&aelig;nestine families seem to have
been taken into the Roman patriciate, as were some from
Alba Longa,<a name="FNanchor_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168"><sup>[168]</sup></a>
nor did Pr&aelig;neste ever send any citizens of
note to Rome, who were honored as was Cato from Tusculum,<a
 name="FNanchor_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169"><sup>[169]</sup></a>
although one branch of the gens Anicia<a name="FNanchor_170"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_170"><sup>[170]</sup></a> did gain
some reputation in imperial times. Rome and Pr&aelig;neste
seemed destined to be ever at cross purposes, and their
ancient rivalry grew to be a traditional dislike which remained
mutual and lasting.</p>
<p>The continuance of the commercial and military rivalry
because of Pr&aelig;neste's strategic position as key of Rome,
and the religious rivalry due to the great fame of Fortuna
Primigenia at Pr&aelig;neste, are continuous and striking historical
facts even down into the middle ages. Once in 1297
and again in 1437 the forces of the Pope destroyed the
town to crush the great Colonna family which had made
Pr&aelig;neste a stronghold against the power of Rome.</p>
<p>There are a great many reasons why Pr&aelig;neste offers the
best opportunity for a study of the municipal officers of a
town of the Latin league. She kept a practical autonomy
longer than any other of the league towns with the exception
of Tibur, but she has a much more varied history than
Tibur. The inscriptions of Pr&aelig;neste offer especial advantages,
because they are numerous and cover a wide range.
The great number of the old pigne inscriptions gives a better
list of names of the citizens of the second century B.C.
and earlier than can be found in any other Latin town.<a
 name="FNanchor_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171"><sup>[171]</sup></a>
Pr&aelig;neste also has more municipal fasti preserved than any
other city, and this fact alone is sufficient reason for a
study of municipal officers. In fact, the position which
Pr&aelig;neste held during the rise and fall of the Latin League
has distinct differences from that of any other town in the
confederation, and these differences are to be seen in every
stage of her history, whether as an ally, a municipium, or
a colonia.</p>
<p>As an ally of Rome, Pr&aelig;neste did not have a curtailed
treaty as did Alba Longa,<a name="FNanchor_172"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_172"><sup>[172]</sup></a> but one on equal terms
(foedus
&aelig;quum), such as was accorded to a sovereign state. This
is proved by the right of exile which both Pr&aelig;neste and
Tibur still retained until as late as 90 B.C.<a name="FNanchor_173"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_173"><sup>[173]</sup></a></p>
<p>As a municipium, the rights of Pr&aelig;neste were shared by
only one other city in the league. She was not a municipium
which, like Lanuvium and Tusculum,<a name="FNanchor_174"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_174"><sup>[174]</sup></a> kept a separate state,
but whose citizens, although called Roman citizens, were
without right to vote, nor, on the other hand, was she in
the class of municipia of which Aricia is a type, towns which
had no vote in Rome, but were governed from there like a
city ward.<a name="FNanchor_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175"><sup>[175]</sup></a>
Pr&aelig;neste, on the contrary, belonged to yet a
third class. This was the most favored class of all; in fact,
equality was implicit in the agreement with Rome, which
was to the effect that when these cities joined the Roman
state, the inhabitants were to be, first of all, citizens of their
own states.<a name="FNanchor_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176"><sup>[176]</sup></a>
Pr&aelig;neste shared this extraordinary agreement
with Rome with but one other Latin city, Tibur.
The question whether or not Pr&aelig;neste was ever a municipium
in the technical and constitutional sense of the word
is apart from the present discussion, and will be taken up
later.<a name="FNanchor_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177"><sup>[177]</sup></a></p>
<p>As a colony, Pr&aelig;neste has a different history from that
of any other of the colonies founded by Sulla. Because
of her stubborn defence, and her partisanship for
Marius, her walls were razed and her citizens murdered
in numbers almost beyond belief. Yet at a later time,
Sulla with a revulsion of kindness quite characteristic of
him, rebuilt the town, enlarged it, and was most generous
in every way. The sentiment which attached to the famous
antiquity and renown of Pr&aelig;neste was too strong to allow
it to lie in ruins. Further, in colonies the most characteristic
officers were the quattuorviri. Pr&aelig;neste, again different,
shows no trace of such officers.</p>
<p>Indeed, at all times during the history of Latium, Pr&aelig;neste
clearly had a city government different from that of
any other in the old Latin League. For example, before
the Social War<a name="FNanchor_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178"><sup>[178]</sup></a>
both Pr&aelig;neste and Tibur had &aelig;diles and
qu&aelig;stors, but Tibur also had censors,<a name="FNanchor_179"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_179"><sup>[179]</sup></a> Pr&aelig;neste did not.
Lavinium<a name="FNanchor_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180"><sup>[180]</sup></a>
and Pr&aelig;neste were alike in that they both had
pr&aelig;tors. There were dictators in Aricia,<a name="FNanchor_181"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_181"><sup>[181]</sup></a> Lanuvium,<a
 name="FNanchor_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182"><sup>[182]</sup></a>
Nomentum,<a name="FNanchor_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183"><sup>[183]</sup></a>
and Tusculum,<a name="FNanchor_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184"><sup>[184]</sup></a>
but no trace of a dictator
in Pr&aelig;neste.</p>
<p>The first mention of a magistrate from Pr&aelig;neste, a
pr&aelig;tor,
in 319 B.C, is due to a joke of the Roman dictator
Papirius Cursor.<a name="FNanchor_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185"><sup>[185]</sup></a>
The pr&aelig;tor was in camp as leader of
the contingent of allies from Pr&aelig;neste,<a name="FNanchor_186"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_186"><sup>[186]</sup></a> and the fact that
a pr&aelig;tor was in command of the troops sent from allied
towns<a name="FNanchor_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187"><sup>[187]</sup></a>
implies that another pr&aelig;tor was at the head of
affairs at home. Another and stronger proof of the government
by two pr&aelig;tors is afforded by the later duoviral
magistracy, and the lack of friction under such an arrangement.</p>
<p>There is no reason to believe that the Latin towns took
as models for their early municipal officers, the consuls at
Rome, rather than to believe that the reverse was the case.
In fact, the change in Rome to the name consuls from pr&aelig;tors,<a
 name="FNanchor_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188"><sup>[188]</sup></a>
with the continuance of the name pr&aelig;tor in the towns
of the Latin League, would rather go to prove that the
Romans had given their two chief magistrates a distinctive
name different from that in use in the neighboring towns,
because the more rapid growth in Rome of magisterial functions
demanded official terminology, as the Romans began
their "Progressive Subdivision of the Magistracy."<a name="FNanchor_189"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_189"><sup>[189]</sup></a>
Livy says that in 341 B.C. Latium had two pr&aelig;tors,<a
 name="FNanchor_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190"><sup>[190]</sup></a>
and this shows two things: first, that two pr&aelig;tors were
better adapted to circumstances than one dictator; second,
that the majority of the towns had pr&aelig;tors, and had had
them, as chief magistrates, and not dictators,<a name="FNanchor_191"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_191"><sup>[191]</sup></a> and that
such an arrangement was more satisfactory. The Latin
League had had a dictator<a name="FNanchor_192"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_192"><sup>[192]</sup></a> at its head at some time,<a
 name="FNanchor_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193"><sup>[193]</sup></a>
and the fact that these two pr&aelig;tors are found at the
head of the league in 341 B.C. shows the deference to the
more progressive and influential cities of the league, where
pr&aelig;tors were the regular and well known municipal chief
magistrates. Before Pr&aelig;neste was made a colony by Sulla,
the governing body was a senate,<a name="FNanchor_194"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_194"><sup>[194]</sup></a> and the municipal officers
were pr&aelig;tors,<a name="FNanchor_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195"><sup>[195]</sup></a>
&aelig;diles,<a name="FNanchor_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196"><sup>[196]</sup></a>
and qu&aelig;stors,<a name="FNanchor_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197"><sup>[197]</sup></a>
as we know certainly
from inscriptions. In the literature, a pr&aelig;tor is
mentioned in 319 B.C.,<a name="FNanchor_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198"><sup>[198]</sup></a>
in 216 B.C.,<a name="FNanchor_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199"><sup>[199]</sup></a>
and again in
173 B.C. implicitly, in a statement concerning the magistrates
of an allied city.<a name="FNanchor_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200"><sup>[200]</sup></a>
In fact nothing in the inscriptions
or in the literature gives a hint at any change
in the political relations between Pr&aelig;neste and Rome down
to 90 B.C., the year in which the lex Iulia was passed.
If a dictator was ever at the head of the city government
in Pr&aelig;neste, there are none of the proofs remaining, such
as are found in the towns of the Alban Hills, in Etruria,
and in the medix tuticus of the Sabellians. The fact that
no trace of the dictator remains either in Tibur or Pr&aelig;neste
seems to imply that these two towns had better opportunities
for a more rapid development, and that both had pr&aelig;tors
at a very early period.<a name="FNanchor_201"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_201"><sup>[201]</sup></a></p>
<p>However strongly the weight of probabilities make for
proof in the endeavor to find out what the municipal government
of Pr&aelig;neste was, there are a certain number of
facts that can now be stated positively. Before 90 B.C.
the administrative officers of Pr&aelig;neste were two pr&aelig;tors,<a
 name="FNanchor_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202"><sup>[202]</sup></a>
who had the regular &aelig;diles and qu&aelig;stors as assistants.
These officers were elected by the citizens of the place.
There was also a senate, but the qualifications and duties
of its members are uncertain. Some information, however,
is to be derived from the fact that both city officers and
senate were composed in the main of the local nobility.<a
 name="FNanchor_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203"><sup>[203]</sup></a></p>
<p>An important epoch in the history of Pr&aelig;neste begins
with the year 91 B.C. In this year the dispute over the
extension of the franchise to Italy began again, and the
failure of the measure proposed by the tribune M. Livius
Drusus led to an Italian revolt, which soon assumed a serious
aspect. To mitigate or to cripple this revolt (the so-called
Social or Marsic war), a bill was offered and passed
in 90 B.C. This was the famous law (lex Iulia) which
applied to all Italian states that had not revolted, or had
stopped their revolt, and it offered Roman citizenship (civitas)
to all such states, with, however, the remarkable provision,
IF THEY DESIRED IT.<a name="FNanchor_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204"><sup>[204]</sup></a>
At all events, this law either
did not meet the needs of the occasion, or some of the allied
states showed no eagerness to accept Rome's offer. Within
a few months after the lex Iulia had gone into effect, which
was late in the year 90, the lex Plautia Papiria was passed,
which offered Roman citizenship to the citizens (cives et
incol&aelig;) of the federated cities, provided they handed in
their names within sixty days to the city pr&aelig;tor in Rome.<a
 name="FNanchor_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205"><sup>[205]</sup></a></p>
<p>There is no unanimity of opinion as to the status of
Pr&aelig;neste in 90 B.C. The reason is twofold. It has never
been shown whether Pr&aelig;neste at this time belonged technically
to the Latins (Latini) or to the allies (foederati),
and it is not known under which of the two laws just mentioned
she took Roman citizenship. In 338 B.C., after
the close of the Latin war, Pr&aelig;neste and Tibur made either
a special treaty<a name="FNanchor_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206"><sup>[206]</sup></a>
with Rome, as seems most likely, or one
in which the old status quo was reaffirmed. In 268 B.C.
Pr&aelig;neste lost one right of federated cities, that of coinage,<a
 name="FNanchor_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207"><sup>[207]</sup></a>
but continued to hold the right of a sovereign city,
that of exile (ius exilii) in 171 B.C.,<a name="FNanchor_208"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_208"><sup>[208]</sup></a> in common with
Tibur and Naples,<a name="FNanchor_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209"><sup>[209]</sup></a>
and on down to the year 90 at any rate
(see note 9). It is to be remembered too that in the year
216 B.C., after the heroic deeds of the Pr&aelig;nestine cohort
at Casilinum, the inhabitants of Pr&aelig;neste were offered
Roman citizenship, and that they refused it.<a name="FNanchor_210"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_210"><sup>[210]</sup></a> Now if the
citizens of Pr&aelig;neste accepted Roman citizenship in 90 B.C.,
under the conditions of the Julian law (lex Iulia de civitate
sociis danda), then they were still called allies (socii) at
that time.<a name="FNanchor_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211"><sup>[211]</sup></a>
But that the provision in the law, namely,
citizenship, if the allies desired it, did not accomplish its
purpose, is clear from the immediate passage in 89 of the
lex Plautia-Papiria.<a name="FNanchor_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212"><sup>[212]</sup></a>
Probably there was some change
of phraseology which was obnoxious in the Iulia. The
traditional touchiness and pride of the Pr&aelig;nestines makes it
sure that they resisted Roman citizenship as long as they
could, and it seems more likely that it was under the provision
of the Plautia-Papiria than under those of the Iulia that
separate citizenship in Pr&aelig;neste became a thing of the past.
Two years later, in 87 B.C., when, because of the troubles
between the two consuls Cinna and Octavius, Cinna had
been driven from Rome, he went out directly to Pr&aelig;neste
and Tibur, which had lately been received into citizenship,<a
 name="FNanchor_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213"><sup>[213]</sup></a>
tried to get them to revolt again from Rome, and collected
money for the prosecution of the war. This not only shows
that Pr&aelig;neste had lately received Roman citizenship, but
implies also that Rome thus far had not dared to assume any
control of the city, or the consul would not have felt so sure
of his reception.</p>
<br />
<p><a name="MUNICIPIUM"></a>WAS PR&AElig;NESTE A MUNICIPIUM?</p>
<p>Just what relation Pr&aelig;neste bore to Rome between 90 or
89 B.C., when she accepted Roman citizenship, and 82 B.C.
when Sulla made her a colony, is still an unsettled question.
Was Pr&aelig;neste made a municipium by Rome, did Pr&aelig;neste
call herself a municipium, or, because the rights which she
enjoyed and guarded as an ally (civitas foederata) had been
so restricted and curtailed, was she called and considered a
municipium by Rome, but allowed to keep the empty substance
of the name of an allied state?</p>
<p>During the development which followed the gradual extension
of Roman citizenship to the inhabitants of Italy, because
of the increase of the rights of autonomy in the colonies,
and the limitation of the rights formerly enjoyed by
the cities which had belonged to the old confederation or
league (foederati), there came to be small difference between
a colonia and a municipium. While the nominal difference
seems to have still held in legal parlance, in the literature
the two names are often interchanged.<a name="FNanchor_214"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_214"><sup>[214]</sup></a> Mommsen-Marquardt
say<a name="FNanchor_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215"><sup>[215]</sup></a>
that in 90 B.C. under the conditions of the lex
Iulia Pr&aelig;neste became a municipium of the type which kept
its own citizenship (ut municipes essent su&aelig; cuiusque civitatis).<a
 name="FNanchor_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216"><sup>[216]</sup></a>
But if this were true, then Pr&aelig;neste would have
come under the jurisdiction of the city pr&aelig;tor (pr&aelig;tor
urbanus)
in Rome, and there would be pr&aelig;fects to look after
cases for him. Pr&aelig;neste has a very large body of inscriptions
which extend from the earliest to the latest times, and
which are wider in range than those of any other town in
Latium outside Rome. But no inscription mentions a pr&aelig;fect
and here under the circumstances the argumentum ex
silentio is of real constructive value, and constitutes circumstantial
evidence of great weight.<a name="FNanchor_217"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_217"><sup>[217]</sup></a> Pr&aelig;neste had lost her
ancient rights one after the other, but it is sure that she
clung the longest to the separate property right. Now
the property in a municipium is not considered as Roman,
a result of the old sovereign state idea, as given by the
ius Quiritium and ius Gabinorum, although Mommsen says
this had no real practical value.<a name="FNanchor_218"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_218"><sup>[218]</sup></a> So whether Pr&aelig;neste
received Roman citizenship in 90 or in 89 B.C. the spirit
of her past history makes it certain that she demanded a
clause which gave specific rights to the old federated
states, such as had always been in her treaty with Rome.<a
 name="FNanchor_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219"><sup>[219]</sup></a>
There seems to have been no such clause in the lex Iulia of
90 B.C., and this fact gives still another reason, in addition
to the ones mentioned, to conclude that Pr&aelig;neste probably
took citizenship in 89 under the lex Plautia-Papiria.
The extreme cruelty which Sulla used toward Pr&aelig;neste,<a
 name="FNanchor_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220"><sup>[220]</sup></a>
and the great amount of its land<a name="FNanchor_221"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_221"><sup>[221]</sup></a> that he took for his
soldiers when he colonized the place, show that Sulla not
only punished the city because it had sided with Marius, but
that the feeling of a Roman magistrate was uppermost, and
that he was now avenging traditional grievances, as well
as punishing recent obstreperousness.</p>
<p>There seems to be, however, very good reasons for saying
that Pr&aelig;neste never became a municipium in the strict
legal sense of the word. First, the particular officials who
belong to a municipium, pr&aelig;fects and quattuorvirs, are not
found at all;<a name="FNanchor_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222"><sup>[222]</sup></a>
second, the use of the word municipium in
literature in connection with Pr&aelig;neste is general, and means
simply "town";<a name="FNanchor_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223"><sup>[223]</sup></a>
third, the fact that Pr&aelig;neste, along with
Tibur, had clung so jealously to the title of federated state
(civitas foederata) from some uncertain date to the time of
the Latin rebellion, and more proudly than ever from 338
to 90 B.C., makes it very unlikely that so great a downfall
of a city's pride would be passed over in silence; fourth and
last, the fact that the Pr&aelig;nestines asked the emperor Tiberius
to give them the status of a municipium,<a name="FNanchor_224"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_224"><sup>[224]</sup></a> which he did,<a
 name="FNanchor_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225"><sup>[225]</sup></a>
but it seems (see note 60) with no change from the regular
city officials of a colony,<a name="FNanchor_226"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_226"><sup>[226]</sup></a> shows clearly that the
Pr&aelig;nestines
simply took advantage of the fact that Tiberius had just
recovered from a severe illness at Pr&aelig;neste<a name="FNanchor_227"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_227"><sup>[227]</sup></a> to ask him for
what was merely an empty honor. It only salved the
pride of the Pr&aelig;nestines, for it gave them a name
which showed a former sovereign federated state, and
not the name of a colony planted by the Romans.<a name="FNanchor_228"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_228"><sup>[228]</sup></a> The
cogency of this fourth reason will bear elaboration. Pr&aelig;neste
would never have asked for a return to the name
municipium if it had not meant something. At the very
best she could not have been a real municipium with Roman
citizenship longer than seven years, 89 to 82 B.C., and that
at a very unsettled time, nor would an enforced taking of
the status of a municipium, not to mention the ridiculously
short period which it would have lasted, have been anything
to look back to with such pride that the inhabitants would
ask the emperor Tiberius for it again. What they did ask
for was the name municipium as they used and understood
it, for it meant to them everything or anything but colonia.</p>
<p>Let us now sum up the municipal history of Pr&aelig;neste
down to 82 B.C. when she was made a Roman colony
by Sulla. Pr&aelig;neste, from the earliest times, like Rome,
Tusculum, and Aricia, was one of the chief cities in the
territory known as Ancient Latium. Like these other
cities, Pr&aelig;neste made herself head of a small league,<a
 name="FNanchor_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229"><sup>[229]</sup></a>
but unlike the others, offers nothing but comparative probability
that she was ever ruled by kings or dictators. So
of prime importance not only in the study of the municipal
officers of Pr&aelig;neste, but also in the question of
Pr&aelig;neste's
relationship to Rome, is the fact that the evidence from
first to last is for pr&aelig;tors as the chief executive officers of
the Pr&aelig;nestine state (respublica), with their regular attendant
officers, &aelig;diles and qu&aelig;stors; all of whom probably
stood for office in the regular succession (cursus honorum).
Above these officers was a senate, an administrative or advisory
body. But although Pr&aelig;neste took Roman citizenship
either in 90 or 89 B.C.,<a name="FNanchor_213bis"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_213"><sup>[213]</sup></a> it seems most likely that
she
was not legally termed a municipium, but that she came in
under some special clause, or with some particular understanding,
whereby she kept her autonomy, at least in name.
Pr&aelig;neste certainly considered herself a federate city, on
the old terms of equality with Rome, she demanded and
partially retained control of her own land, and preserved
her freedom from Rome in the matter of city elections and
magistrates.</p>
<br />
<p><a name="COLONY"></a>PR&AElig;NESTE AS A COLONY.</p>
<p>From the time of Sulla to the establishment of the monarchy,
the expropriation of territory for discharged soldiers
found its expression in great part in the change from Italian
cities to colonies,<a name="FNanchor_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230"><sup>[230]</sup></a>
and of the colonies newly made by
Sulla, Pr&aelig;neste was one. The misfortunes that befell
Pr&aelig;neste,
because she seemed doomed to be on the losing side
in quarrels, were never more disastrously exemplified than
in the punishment inflicted upon her by Sulla, because she
had taken the side of Marius. Thousands of her citizens
were killed (see <a href="#Footnote_220">note 220</a>), her
fortifications were thrown
down, a great part of her territory was taken and given to
Sulla's soldiers, who were the settlers of his new-made colony.
At once the city government of Pr&aelig;neste changed.
Instead of a senate, there was now a decuria (decuriones,
ordo); instead of pr&aelig;tors, duovirs with judicial powers
(iure dicundo), in short, the regular governmental officialdom
for a Roman colony. The city offices were filled
partly by the new colonists, and the new government which
was forced upon her was so thoroughly established, that
Pr&aelig;neste remained a colony as long as her history can be
traced in the inscriptions. As has been said, in the time
of Tiberius she got back an empty title, that of municipium,
but it had been nearly forgotten again by Hadrian's time.</p>
<p>There are several unanswered questions which arise at
this point. What was the distribution of offices in the colony
after its foundation; what regulation, if any, was there
as to the proportion of officials to the new make up of the
population; and what and who were the quinquennial
duovirs? From the proportionately large fragments of
municipal fasti left from Pr&aelig;neste it will be possible to
reach some conclusions that may be of future value.</p>
<br />
<p><a name="OFFICES"></a>THE DISTRIBUTION OF OFFICES.</p>
<p>The beginning of this question comes from a passage in
Cicero,<a name="FNanchor_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231"><sup>[231]</sup></a>
which says that the Sullan colonists in Pompeii
were preferred in the offices, and had a status of citizenship
better than that of the old inhabitants of the city. Such a
state of affairs might also seem natural in a colony which
had just been deprived of one third of its land, and had had
forced upon it as citizens a troop of soldiers who naturally
would desire to keep the city offices as far as possible in
their own control.<a name="FNanchor_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232"><sup>[232]</sup></a>
Dessau thinks that because this unequal
state of citizenship was found in Pompeii, which
was a colony of Sulla's, it must have been found also
in Pr&aelig;neste, another of his colonies.<a name="FNanchor_233"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_233"><sup>[233]</sup></a> Before entering
into the question of whether or not this can be
proved, it will be well to mention three probable reasons
why Dessau is wrong in his contention. The first,
an argumentum ex silentio, is that if there was trouble in
Pompeii between the old inhabitants and the new colonists
then the same would have been true in Pr&aelig;neste! As it
was so close to Rome, however, the trouble would have been
much better known, and certainly Cicero would not have
lost a chance to bring the state of affairs at Pr&aelig;neste also
into a comparison. Second, the great pains Sulla took to
rebuild the walls of Pr&aelig;neste, to lay out a new forum, and
especially to make such an extensive enlargement and so
many repairs of the temple of Fortuna Primigenia, show
that his efforts were not entirely to please his new colonists,
but just as much to try to defer to the wishes and civic
pride of the old settlers. Third, the fact that a great
many of the old inhabitants were left, despite the great
slaughter at the capture of the city, is shown by the frequent
recurrence in later inscriptions of the ancient names
of the city, and by the fact that within twenty years the
property of the soldier colonists had been bought up,<a
 name="FNanchor_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234"><sup>[234]</sup></a>
and
the soldiers had died, or had moved to town, or reenlisted
for foreign service. Had there been much trouble between
the colonists and the old inhabitants, or had the colonists
taken all the offices, in either case they would not have been
so ready to part with their land, which was a sort of patent
to citizenship.</p>
<p>It is possible now to push the inquiry a point further.
Dessau has already seen<a name="FNanchor_235"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_235"><sup>[235]</sup></a> that in the time of Augustus
members of the old families were again in possession of
many municipal offices, but he thinks the Pr&aelig;nestines did
not have as good municipal rights as the colonists in the
years following the establishment of the colony. There
are six inscriptions<a name="FNanchor_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236"><sup>[236]</sup></a>
which contain lists more or less fragmentary
of the magistrates of Pr&aelig;neste, the duovirs, the
&aelig;diles, and the qu&aelig;stors. Two of these inscriptions can
be dated within a few years, for they show the election of
Germanicus and Drusus C&aelig;sar, and of Nero and Drusus,
the sons of Germanicus, to the quinquennial duovirate.<a
 name="FNanchor_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237"><sup>[237]</sup></a>
Two others<a name="FNanchor_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238"><sup>[238]</sup></a>
are certainly pieces of the same fasti because
of several peculiarities,<a name="FNanchor_239"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_239"><sup>[239]</sup></a> and one other, a fragment,
belongs to still another calendar.<a name="FNanchor_240"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_240"><sup>[240]</sup></a> It will first be necessary
to show that these last-mentioned inscriptions can be
referred to some time not much later than the founding
of the colony at Pr&aelig;neste by Sulla, before any use can
be made of the names in the list to prove anything about
the early distribution of officers in the colony. Two
of these inscriptions<a href="#Footnote_238"><sup>[238]</sup></a>
should be placed, I think, very
early in the annals of the colony. They show a list of
municipal officers whose names, with a single exception,
which will be accounted for later, have only pr&aelig;nomen and
nomen, a way of writing names which was common to
the earlier inhabitants of Pr&aelig;neste, and which seems to
have made itself felt here in the names of the colonists.<a
 name="FNanchor_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241"><sup>[241]</sup></a>
Again, from the fact that in the only place in the inscriptions
where the quinquennialship is mentioned, it is the
simple term, without the prefixed duoviri. In the later
inscriptions from imperial times,<a name="FNanchor_237bis"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_237"><sup>[237]</sup></a> both forms are found,
while in the year 31 A.D. in the municipal fasti of Nola<a
 name="FNanchor_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242"><sup>[242]</sup></a>
are found II vir(i) iter(um) q(uinquennales), and in 29
B.C. in the fasti from Venusia,<a name="FNanchor_243"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_243"><sup>[243]</sup></a> officials with the same
title, duoviri quinquennales, which show that the officers of
the year in which the census was taken were given both
titles. Marquardt makes this a proof that the quinquennial
title shows nothing more than a function of the regular
duovir.<a name="FNanchor_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244"><sup>[244]</sup></a>
It is certain too that after the passage of the lex
Iulia in 45 B.C., that the census was taken in the Italian
towns at the same time as in Rome, and the reports sent to
the censor in Rome.<a name="FNanchor_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245"><sup>[245]</sup></a>
This duty was performed by the
duovirs with quinquennial power, also often called censorial
power.<a name="FNanchor_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246"><sup>[246]</sup></a>
The inscriptions under consideration, then, would
seem to date certainly before 49 B.C.</p>
<p>Another reason for placing these inscriptions in the very
early days of the colony is derived from the use of names.
In this list of officials<a name="FNanchor_247"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_247"><sup>[247]</sup></a> there is a duovir by the
name of
P. Cornelius, and another whose name is lost except for the
cognomen, Dolabella, but he can be no other than a Cornelius,
for this cognomen belongs to that family.<a name="FNanchor_248"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_248"><sup>[248]</sup></a> Early
in the life of the colony, immediately after its settlement,
during the repairs and rebuilding of the city's
monuments,<a name="FNanchor_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249"><sup>[249]</sup></a>
while the soldiers from Sulla's army were the
new citizens of the town, would be the time to look for
men in the city offices whose election would have been due
to Sulla, or would at least appear to have been a compliment
to him. Sulla was one of the most famous of the
family of the Cornelii, and men of the gens Cornelia might
well have expected preferment during the early years of
the colony. That such was the case is shown here by the
recurrence of the name Cornelius in the list of municipal
officers in two succeeding years. Now if the name "Cornelia"
grew to be a name in great disfavor in Pr&aelig;neste, the
reason would be plain enough. The destruction of the
town, the loss of its ancient liberties, and the change in its
government, are more than enough to assure hatred of the
man who had been the cause of the disasters. And there is
proof too that the Pr&aelig;nestines did keep a lasting dislike to
the name "Cornelia." There are many inscriptions of Pr&aelig;neste
which show the names (nomina) &AElig;lia, Antonia, Aurelia,
Claudia, Flavia, Iulia, Iunia, Marcia, Petronia, Valeria,
among others, but besides the two Cornelii in this inscription
under consideration, and one other<a name="FNanchor_250"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_250"><sup>[250]</sup></a> mentioned in
the fragment above (see note 83), there are practically no
people of that name found in Pr&aelig;neste,<a name="FNanchor_251"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_251"><sup>[251]</sup></a> and the name is
frequent enough in other towns of the old Latin league.
From these reasons, namely, the way in which only pr&aelig;nomina
and nomina are used, the simple, earlier use of quinquennalis,
and especially the appearance of the name Cornelius
here, and never again until in the late empire, it follows
that the names of the municipal officers of Pr&aelig;neste
given in these inscriptions certainly date between 81 and
50 B.C.<a name="FNanchor_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252"><sup>[252]</sup></a></p>
<br />
<p><a name="OFFICIALS"></a>THE REGULATIONS ABOUT OFFICIALS.</p>
<p>The question now arises whether the new colonists had
better rights legally than the old citizens, and whether they
had the majority of votes and elected city officers from their
own number. The inscriptions with which we have to deal
are both fragments of lists of city officers, and in the longer
of the two, one gives the officers for four years, the corresponding
column for two years and part of a third.
A Dolabella, who belongs to the gens Cornelia, as we have
seen, heads the list as duovir. The &aelig;dile for the same year
is a certain Rotanius.<a name="FNanchor_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253"><sup>[253]</sup></a>
This name is not found in the
sepulchral inscriptions of the city of Rome, nor in the inscriptions
of Pr&aelig;neste except in this one instance. This
man is certainly one of the new colonists, and probably a
soldier from North Italy.<a name="FNanchor_254"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_254"><sup>[254]</sup></a> Both the qu&aelig;stors of
the same
year are given. They are M. Samiarius and Q. Flavius.
Samiarius is one of the famous old names of Pr&aelig;neste.<a
 name="FNanchor_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255"><sup>[255]</sup></a>
In
the same way, the duovirs of the next year, C. Messienus and
P. Cornelius, belong, the one to Pr&aelig;neste, the other to the
colonists,<a name="FNanchor_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256"><sup>[256]</sup></a>
and just such an arrangement is also found in the
&aelig;diles, Sex. C&aelig;sius being a Pr&aelig;nestine<a
 name="FNanchor_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257"><sup>[257]</sup></a>,
L. Nassius a colonist.
Q. Caleius and C. Sertorius, the qu&aelig;stors of the same
year, do not appear in the inscriptions of Pr&aelig;neste except
here, and it is impossible to say more than that Sertorius is
a good Roman name, and Caleius a good north Italian one.<a
 name="FNanchor_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258"><sup>[258]</sup></a>
C. Salvius and T. Lucretius, duovirs for the next year,
the recurrence of Salvius in another inscription,<a name="FNanchor_259"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_259"><sup>[259]</sup></a> L.
Curtius and C. Vibius, the &aelig;diles,&#8212;Statiolenus and C.
Cassius, the qu&aelig;stors, show the same phenomenon, for it
seems quite possible from other inscriptional evidence to
claim Salvius, Vibius,<a name="FNanchor_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260"><sup>[260]</sup></a>
and Statiolenus<a name="FNanchor_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261"><sup>[261]</sup></a>
as men from the
old families of Pr&aelig;neste. The quinquennalis for the next
year, M. Petronius, has a name too widely prevalent to
allow any certainty as to his native place, but the nomen
Petronia and Ptronia is an old name in Pr&aelig;neste.<a
 name="FNanchor_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262"><sup>[262]</sup></a>
In the second column of the inscription, although the majority
of the names there seem to belong to the new colonists,
as those in the first column do to the old settlers, there are
two names, Q. Arrasidius and T. Apponius, which do not
make for the argument either way.<a name="FNanchor_263"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_263"><sup>[263]</sup></a> In the smaller fragment
there are but six names: M. Decumius and L. Ferlidius,
C. Paccius and C. Ninn(ius), C. Albinius and Sex.
Capivas, but from these one gets only good probabilities.
The nomen Decumia is well attested in Pr&aelig;neste before
the time of Sulla.<a name="FNanchor_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264"><sup>[264]</sup></a>
In fact the same name, M. Decumius,
is among the old pigne inscriptions.<a name="FNanchor_265"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_265"><sup>[265]</sup></a> Paccia has been
found this past year in Pr&aelig;nestine territory, and may well
be an old Pr&aelig;nestine name, for the inscriptions of a family
of the name Paccia have come to light at Gallicano.<a
 name="FNanchor_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266"><sup>[266]</sup></a>
Capivas is at least not a Roman name,<a name="FNanchor_267"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_267"><sup>[267]</sup></a> but from its scarcity
in other places can as well be one of the names that are
so frequent in Pr&aelig;neste, which show Etruscan or Sabine
formation, and which prove that before Sulla's time the
city had a great many inhabitants who had come from
Etruria and from back in the Sabine mountains. Ninnius<a
 name="FNanchor_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268"><sup>[268]</sup></a>
is a name not found elsewhere in the Latian
towns, but the name belonged to the nobility near Capua,<a
 name="FNanchor_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269"><sup>[269]</sup></a>
and is found also in Pompeii<a name="FNanchor_270"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_270"><sup>[270]</sup></a> and Puteoli.<a
 name="FNanchor_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271"><sup>[271]</sup></a>
It seems
a fair supposition to make at the outset, as we have
seen that various writers on Pr&aelig;neste have done, that
the new colonists would try to keep the highest office to
themselves, at any rate, particularly the duovirate. But a
study of the names, as has been the case with the less important
officers, fails even to bear this out.<a name="FNanchor_272"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_272"><sup>[272]</sup></a> These
lists of municipal officers show a number of names
that belong with certainty to the older families of Pr&aelig;neste,
and thus warrant the statement that the colonists did not
have better rights than the old settlers, and that not even
in the duovirate, which held an effective check (maior
potestas)<a name="FNanchor_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273"><sup>[273]</sup></a>
on the &aelig;diles and qu&aelig;stors, can the names of the
new colonists be shown to outnumber or take the place of
the old settlers.</p>
<br />
<p><a name="QUINQUENNALES"></a>THE QUINQUENNALES.</p>
<p>There remains yet the question in regard to the men who
filled the quinquennial office. We know that whether the
officials of the municipal governments were pr&aelig;tors,
&aelig;diles,
duovirs, or quattuorvirs, at intervals of five years their
titles either were quinquennales,<a name="FNanchor_274"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_274"><sup>[274]</sup></a> or had that added
to them, and that this title implied censorial duties.<a
 name="FNanchor_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275"><sup>[275]</sup></a>
It has also been shown that after 46 B.C. the lex Iulia
compelled the census in the various Roman towns to be
taken by the proper officers in the same year that it was done
in Rome. This implies that the taking of the census had
been so well established a custom that it was a long time
before Rome itself had cared to enact a law which changed
the year of census taking in those towns which had not of
their own volition made their census contemporaneous with
that in Rome.</p>
<p>That the duration of the quinquennial office was one year
is certain,<a name="FNanchor_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276"><sup>[276]</sup></a>
that it was eponymous is also sure,<a name="FNanchor_277"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_277"><sup>[277]</sup></a> but
whether the officers who performed these duties every five
years did so in addition to holding the highest office of the
year, or in place of that honor, is a question not at all
satisfactorily
answered. That is, were the men who held the
quinquennial office the men who would in all probability
have stood for the duovirate in the regular succession of
advance in the round of offices (cursus honorum), or did
the government at Rome in some way, either directly or
indirectly, name the men for the highest office in that particular
year when the census was to be taken? That is,
again, were quinquennales elected as the other city officials
were, or were they appointed by Rome, or were they merely
designated by Rome, and then elected in the proper and
regular way by the citizens of the towns?</p>
<p>At first glance it seems most natural to suppose that Rome
would want exact returns from the census, and might for
that reason try to dictate the men who were to take it, for
on the census had been based always the military taxes, contingents,
etc.<a name="FNanchor_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278"><sup>[278]</sup></a>
The first necessary inquiry is whether the
quinquennales were men who previously had held office as
qu&aelig;stors or &aelig;diles, and the best place to begin such a
search
is in the municipal calendars (fasti magistratuum municipalium),
which give the city officials with their rank.</p>
<p>There are fragments left of several municipal fasti; the
one which gives the longest unbroken list is that from
Venusia,<a name="FNanchor_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279"><sup>[279]</sup></a>
which gives the full list of the city officials of
the years 34-29 B.C., and the &aelig;diles of 35, and both the
duovirs and pr&aelig;tors of the first half of 28 B.C. In 29
B.C., L. Oppius and L. Livius were duoviri quinquennales.
These are both good old Roman names, and stand out the
more in contrast with Narius, Mestrius, Plestinus, and Fadius,
the &aelig;diles and qu&aelig;stors. Neither of these quinquennales
had held any office in the five preceding years at all
events. One of the two qu&aelig;stors of the year 33 B.C. is a L.
Cornelius. The next year a L. Cornelius, with the greatest
probability the same man, is pr&aelig;fect, and again in the year
30 he is duovir. Also in the year 32 L. Scutarius is qu&aelig;stor,
and in the last half of 31 is duovir. C. Geminius Niger is
&aelig;dile in 30, and duovir in 28. So what we learn is that
a L. Cornelius held the qu&aelig;storship one year, was a pr&aelig;fect
the next, and later a regularly elected duovir; that L. Scutarius
went from qu&aelig;stor one year to duovir the next, without
an intervening office, and but a half year of intervening
time; and that C. Geminius Niger was successively &aelig;dile and
duovir with a break of one year between.</p>
<p>The fasti of Nola<a name="FNanchor_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280"><sup>[280]</sup></a>
give the duovirs and &aelig;diles for four
years, 29-32 A.D., but none of the &aelig;diles mentioned rose to
the duovirate within the years given. Nor do we get any
help from the fasti of Interamna Lirenatis<a name="FNanchor_281"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_281"><sup>[281]</sup></a> or Ostia,<a
 name="FNanchor_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282"><sup>[282]</sup></a>
so the only other calendar we have to deal with is the one
from Pr&aelig;neste, the fragments of which have been partially
discussed above.</p>
<p>The text of that piece<a name="FNanchor_283"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_283"><sup>[283]</sup></a> which dates from the first
years
of Tiberius' reign is so uncertain that one gets little information
from it. But certainly the M. Petronius Rufus
who is pr&aelig;fect for Drusus C&aelig;sar is the same as the
Petronius
Rufus who in another place is duovir. The name
of C. Dindius appears twice also, once with the office of
&aelig;dile, but two years later seemingly as &aelig;dile again, which
must be a mistake. M. Cominius Bassus is made quinquennalis
by order of the senate, and also made pr&aelig;fect for Germanicus
and Drusus C&aelig;sar in their quinquennial year. He
is not found in any other inscription, and is otherwise unknown.<a
 name="FNanchor_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284"><sup>[284]</sup></a>
The only other men who attained the quinquennial
rank in Pr&aelig;neste were M. Petronius,<a name="FNanchor_285"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_285"><sup>[285]</sup></a> and some man
with the cognomen Minus,<a name="FNanchor_286"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_286"><sup>[286]</sup></a> neither of whom appears
anywhere
else. A man with the cognomen Sedatus is qu&aelig;stor
in one year, and without holding other office is made pr&aelig;fect
to the sons of Germanicus, Nero and Drusus, who were
nominated quinquennales two years later.<a name="FNanchor_287"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_287"><sup>[287]</sup></a> There is no
positive proof in any of the fasti that any quinquennalis
was elected from one of the lower magistrates. There
is proof that duovirs were elected, who had been &aelig;diles or
qu&aelig;stors. Also it has been shown that in two cases men
who had been qu&aelig;stors were made pr&aelig;fects, that is,
appointees
of people who had been nominated quinquennales
as an honor, and who had at once appointed pr&aelig;fects to
carry out their duties.</p>
<p>Another question of importance rises here. Who were
the quinquennales? They were not always inhabitants of
the city to the office of which they had been nominated, as
has been shown in the cases of Drusus and Germanicus
C&aelig;sar, and Nero and Drusus the sons of Germanicus, nominated
or elected quinquennales at Pr&aelig;neste, and represented
in both cases by pr&aelig;fects appointed by them.<a name="FNanchor_288"></a><a

<p>From Ostia comes an inscription which was set up by the
grain measurers' union to Q. Petronius Q.f. Melior, etc.,<a
 name="FNanchor_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289"><sup>[289]</sup></a>
pr&aelig;tor of a small town some ten miles from Ostia, and
also quattuorvir quinquennalis of F&aelig;sul&aelig;, a town above
Florence, which seems to show that he was sent to F&aelig;sul&aelig;
as a quinquennalis, for the honor which he had held previously
was that of pr&aelig;tor in Laurentum.</p>
<p>At Tibur, in Hadrian's time, a L. Minicius L.f. Gal.
Natalis Quadromius Verus, who had held offices previously
in Africa, in Moesia, and in Britain, was made quinquennalis
maximi exempli. It seems certain that he was not a
resident of Tibur, and since he was not appointed as pr&aelig;fect
by Hadrian, it seems quite reasonable to think that
either the emperor had a right to name a quinquennalis, or
that he was asked to name one,<a name="FNanchor_290"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_290"><sup>[290]</sup></a> when one remembers the
proximity of Hadrian's great villa, and the deference the
people of Tibur showed the emperor. There is also in
Tibur an inscription to a certain Q. Pompeius Senecio, etc.&#8212;(the
man had no less than thirty-eight names), who was
an officer in Asia in 169 A.D., a pr&aelig;fect of the Latin
games (pr&aelig;fectus feriarum Latinarum), then later a quinquennalis
of Tibur, after which he was made patron of the
city (patronus municipii).<a name="FNanchor_291"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_291"><sup>[291]</sup></a> A Roman knight, C.
&AElig;milius
Antoninus, was first quinquennalis, then patronus municipii
at Tibur.<a name="FNanchor_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292"><sup>[292]</sup></a></p>
<p>N. Cluvius M'. f.<a name="FNanchor_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293"><sup>[293]</sup></a>
was a quattuorvir at Caudium, a
duovir at Nola, and a quattuorvir quinquennalis at Capua,
which again shows that a quinquennalis need not have been
an official previously in the town in which he held the quinquennial
office.</p>
<p>C. M&aelig;nius C.f. Bassus<a name="FNanchor_294"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_294"><sup>[294]</sup></a> was &aelig;dile and
quattuorvir at
Herculaneum and then after holding the tribuneship of a
legion is found next at Pr&aelig;neste as a quinquennalis.</p>
<p>M. Vettius M.f. Valens<a name="FNanchor_295"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_295"><sup>[295]</sup></a> is called in an inscription
duovir quinquennalis of the emperor Trajan, which shows
not an appointment from the emperor in his place, for that
would have been as a pr&aelig;fect, but rather that the emperor
had nominated him, as an imperial right. This man held
a number of priestly offices, was patron of the colony of
Ariminum, and is called optimus civis.</p>
<p>Another inscription shows plainly that a man who had
been quinquennalis in his own home town was later made
quinquennalis in a colony founded by Augustus, Hispellum.<a
 name="FNanchor_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296"><sup>[296]</sup></a>
This man, C. Alfius, was probably nominated quinquennalis
by the emperor.</p>
<p>C. Pompilius Cerialis,<a name="FNanchor_297"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_297"><sup>[297]</sup></a> who seems to have held only
one
other office, that of pr&aelig;fect to Drusus C&aelig;sar in an army
legion, was duovir iure dicundo quinquennalis in Volaterr&aelig;.</p>
<p>M. Oppius Capito was not only quinquennalis twice at
Auximum, patron of that and another colony, but he was
patron of the municipium of Numana, and also quinquennalis.<a
 name="FNanchor_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298"><sup>[298]</sup></a></p>
<p>Q. Octavius L.f. Sagitta was twice quinquennalis at
Super&aelig;quum, and held no other offices.<a name="FNanchor_299"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_299"><sup>[299]</sup></a></p>
<p>Again, particularly worthy of notice is the fact that when
L. Septimius L.f. Calvus, who had been &aelig;dile and quattuorvir
at Teate Marrucinorum, was given the quinquennial
rights, it was of such importance that it needed especial
mention, and that such mention was made by a decree of
the city senate,<a name="FNanchor_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300"><sup>[300]</sup></a>
shows clearly that such a method of getting
a quinquennalis was out of the ordinary.</p>
<p>M. Nasellius Sabinus of Beneventum<a name="FNanchor_301"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_301"><sup>[301]</sup></a> has the title
Augustalis duovir quinquennalis, and no other title but that
of pr&aelig;fect of a cohort.</p>
<p>C. Egnatius Marus of Venusia was flamen of the emperor
Tiberius, pontifex, and pr&aelig;fectus fabrum, and three times
duovir quinquennalis, which seems to show a deference to
a man who was the priest of the emperor, and seems to preclude
an election by the citizens after a regular term of
other offices.<a name="FNanchor_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302"><sup>[302]</sup></a></p>
<p>Q. Laronius was a quinquennalis at Vibo Valentia by
order of the senate, which again shows the irregularity of
the choice.<a name="FNanchor_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303"><sup>[303]</sup></a></p>
<p>M. Tr&aelig;sius Faustus was quinquennalis of Potentia, but
died an inhabitant of Atin&aelig; in Lucania.<a name="FNanchor_304"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_304"><sup>[304]</sup></a></p>
<p>M. Alleius Luccius Libella, who was &aelig;dile and duovir in
Pompeii,<a name="FNanchor_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305"><sup>[305]</sup></a>
was not elected quinquennalis, but made pr&aelig;fectus
quinquennalis, which implies appointment.</p>
<p>M. Holconius Celer was a priest of Augustus, and with
no previous city offices is mentioned as quinquennalis-elect,
which can perhaps as well mean nominated by the emperor,
as designated by the popular vote.<a name="FNanchor_306"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_306"><sup>[306]</sup></a></p>
<p>P. Sextilius Rufus,<a name="FNanchor_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307"><sup>[307]</sup></a>
&aelig;dile twice in Nola, is quinquennalis
in Pompeii. As he was chosen by the old inhabitants
of Nola to their senate, this would show that he belonged
probably to the new settlers in the colony introduced by
Augustus, and for some reason was called over also to Pompeii
to take the quinquennial office.</p>
<p>L. Aufellius Rufus at Cales was advanced from the position
of primipilus of a legion to that of quinquennalis, without
having held any other city offices, but he was flamen of
the deified emperor (Divus Augustus), and patron of the
city.<a name="FNanchor_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308"><sup>[308]</sup></a></p>
<p>M. Barronius Sura went directly to quinquennalis without
being &aelig;dile or qu&aelig;stor, in Aquinum.<a name="FNanchor_309"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_309"><sup>[309]</sup></a></p>
<p>Q. Decius Saturninus was a quattuorvir at Verona, but
a quinquennalis at Aquinum.<a name="FNanchor_310"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_310"><sup>[310]</sup></a></p>
<p>The quinquennial year seems to have been the year in
which matters of consequence were more likely to be done
than at other times.</p>
<p>In 166 A.D. in Ostia a dedication was of importance
enough to have the names of both the consuls of the year
and the duoviri quinquennales at the head of the inscription.<a
 name="FNanchor_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311"><sup>[311]</sup></a></p>
<p>The year that C. Cuperius and C. Arrius were quinquennales
with censorial power (II vir c.p.q.) in Ostia, there
was a dedication of some importance in connection with a
tree that had been struck by lightning.<a name="FNanchor_312"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_312"><sup>[312]</sup></a></p>
<p>In Gabii a decree in honor of the house of Domitia Augusta
was passed in the year when there were quinquennales.<a
 name="FNanchor_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313"><sup>[313]</sup></a></p>
<p>In addition to the fact that the emperors were sometimes
chosen quinquennales, the consuls were too. M'. Acilius
Glabrio, consul ordinarius of 152 A.D., was made patron
of Tibur and quinquennalis designatus.<a name="FNanchor_314"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_314"><sup>[314]</sup></a></p>
<p>On the other hand, against this array of facts, are others
just as certain, if not so cogent or so numerous. From
the inscriptions painted on the walls in Pompeii, we
know that in the first century A.D. men were recommended
as quinquennales to the voters. But although there
seems to be a large list of such inscriptions, they narrow
down a great deal, and in comparison with the number of
duovirs, they are considerably under the proportion one
would expect, for instead of being as 1 to 4, they are really
only as 1 to 19.<a name="FNanchor_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315"><sup>[315]</sup></a>
What makes the candidacy for quinquennialship
seem a new and unaccustomed thing is the
fact that the appeals for votes which are painted here and
there on the walls are almost all recommendations for just
two men.<a name="FNanchor_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316"><sup>[316]</sup></a></p>
<p>There are quinquennales who were made patrons of the
towns in which they held the office, but who held no other
offices there (1); some who were both qu&aelig;stors and &aelig;diles
or pr&aelig;tors (2); quinquennales of both classes again who
were not made patrons (3, 4); pr&aelig;fects with quinquennial
power (5); quinquennales who go in regular order
through the quattuorviral offices (6); those who go direct
to the quinquennial rank from the tribunate of the soldiers
(7); and (8) a VERY FEW who have what seems to be the
regular order of lower offices first, qu&aelig;stor, &aelig;dile or
pr&aelig;tor,
duovir, and then quinquennalis.<a name="FNanchor_317"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_317"><sup>[317]</sup></a></p>
<p>The sum of the facts collected is as follows: the quinquennales
are proved to have been elective officers in Pompeii.
The date, however, is the third quarter of the first
century A.D., and the office may have been but recently
thrown open to election, as has been shown. Quinquennales
who have held other city offices are very, very few,
and they appear in inscriptions of fairly late date.</p>
<p>On the other hand, many quinquennales are found who
hold that office and no other in the city, men who certainly
belong to other towns, many who from their nomination as
patrons of the colony or municipium, are clearly seen to
have held the quinquennial power also as an honor given to
an outsider. In what municipal fasti we have, we find no
quinquennalis whose name appears at all previously in the
list of city officials.</p>
<p>The fact that the lex Iulia in 45 B.C. compelled the census
to be taken everywhere else in the same year as in Rome
shows at all events that the census had been taken in certain
places at other times, whether with an implied supervision
from Rome or not, and the later positive evidence that the
emperors and members of the imperial family, and consuls,
who were nominated quinquennales, always appointed pr&aelig;fects
in their places, who with but an exception or two
were not city officials previously, certainly tends to show
that at some time the quinquennial office had been influenced
in some way from Rome. The appointment of outside
men as an honor would then be a survival of the custom
of having outsiders for quinquennales, in many places
doubtless a revival of a custom which had been in abeyance,
to honor the imperial family.</p>
<p>In Pr&aelig;neste, as in other colonies, it seems reasonable
that Rome would want to keep her hand on affairs to some
extent. Rome imposed on the colonies their new kind of
officials, and in the fixing of duties and rights, what is more
likely than that Rome would reserve a voice in the choice
of those officials who were to turn in the lists on which
Rome had to depend for the census?</p>
<p>Rome always made different treaties and understandings
with her allies; according to circumstances, she made different
arrangements with different colonies; even Sulla's
own colonies show a vast difference in the treatment accorded
them, for the plan was to conciliate the old inhabitants
if they were still numerous enough to make it worth
while, and the gradual change is most clearly shown by its
crystallization in the lex Iulia of 45 B.C.</p>
<p>The evidence seems to warrant the following conclusions
in regard to the quinquennales: From the first they were
the most important city officials; they were elected by the
people from the first, but were men who had been recommended
in some way, or had been indorsed beforehand by
the central government in Rome; they were not necessarily
men who had held office previously in the city to which
they were elected quinquennales; with the spread of the
feeling of real Roman citizenship the necessity for indorsement
from Rome fell into abeyance; magistrates were
elected who had every expectation of going through the
series of municipal offices in the regular way to the quinquennialship;
and the later election of emperors and others
to the quinquennial office was a survival of the habitual
realization that this most honorable of city offices had
some connection with the central authority, whatever that
happened to be, and was not an integral part of municipal
self government.</p>
<p>Such are some of the questions which a study of the
municipal officers of Pr&aelig;neste has raised. It would be
both tedious and unnecessary to enumerate again the offices
which were held in Pr&aelig;neste during her history, but an
attempt to place such a list in a tabular way is made in
the following pages.</p>

<p> The author himself saw all the excavations here along the
road
during the year 1907, of which there is a full account in the Not.
d. Scavi, Ser. 5, 4 (1907), p. 19. Excavations began on these
tombs in 1738, and have been carried on spasmodically ever since.
There were excavations again in 1825 (Marucchi, Guida Archeologica,
p. 21), but it was in 1855 that the more extensive excavations
were made which caused so much stir among arch&aelig;ologists
(Marucchi, l.c., p. 21, notes 1-7). For the excavations see Bull,
dell'Instituto. 1858, p. 93 ff., 1866, p. 133, 1869, p. 164, 1870, p.
97,

in Garucci, Dissertazioni Arch., plate XII. Again in 1862 there
were excavations of importance made in the Vigna Velluti, to the
right of the road to Marcigliano. It was thought that the exact
boundaries of the necropolis on the north and south had been found
because of the little columns of peperino 41 inches high by 8-8/10
inches square, which were in situ, and seemed to serve no other
purpose than that of sepulchral cippi or boundary stones. Garucci,

<p> The temple in Cave is of the same tufa (Fernique, &Eacute;tude sur
Pr&eacute;neste, p. 104). The quarries down toward Gallicano supplied
tufa of the same texture, but the quarries are too small to have
supplied much. But this tufa from the ridge back of the town
seems not to have been used in Gallicano to any great extent,
for the tufa there is of a different kind and comes from the different
cuts in the ridges on either side of the town, and from a
quarry just west of the town across the valley.</p>

a fight. Tomassetti, Della Campagna Romana, p. 183, remarks

<p> Gatti, in Not. d. Scavi, 1903, p. 576, in connection with the
Arlenius inscription, found on the site of the new Forum below
Pr&aelig;neste in 1903, which mentions Ad Duas Casas as confinium
territorio Pr&aelig;nestin&aelig;, thought that it was possible to
identify this
place with a fundus and possessio Duas Casas below Tibur under
Monte Gennaro, and thus to extend the domain of Pr&aelig;neste that
far, but as Huelsen saw (Mitth. des k.d. Arch, Inst., 19 (1904),
p. 150), that is manifestly impossible, doubly so from the modern

<p> It might be objected that because Pietro Colonna in 1092 A.D.
assaulted and took Cave as his first step in his revolt against
Clement III (Cecconi, Storia di Palestrina, p. 240), that Cave was
at that time a dependency of Pr&aelig;neste. But it has been shown that
Pr&aelig;neste's diocesan territory expanded and shrunk very much at
different times, and that in general the extent of a diocese, when
larger, depends on principles which ancient topography will not
allow. And too it can as well be said that Pietro Colonna was
paying up ancient grudge against Cave, and certainly also he realized
that of all the towns near Pr&aelig;neste, Cave was strategically
the best from which to attack, and this most certainly shows that
in ancient times such natural barriers between the two must
have
been practically impassable.</p>

<p> To anticipate any one saying that this scarping is modern,

on
the whole the best one on Pr&aelig;neste but leaves much to be desired
when the question is one of topography or epigraphy (see Dessau's
comment C.I.L., XIV, p. 294, n. 4). Even Marucchi, Guida Arch., p.
68, n. 1, took the word of a citizen of the town who wrote him that
parts of a wall of opus quadratum could be traced along the Via
dello Spregato, and so fell into error. Blondel, M&eacute;langes
d'arch&eacute;ologie
et d'histoire de l'&eacute;cole fran&ccedil;aise de Rome, 1882, plate

<p> Nibby, Analisi, II, p. 511, wrote his note on the wall beyond
San Francesco from memory. He says that one follows the
monastery wall down, and then comes to a big reservoir. The
monastery wall has only a few stones from the cyclopean wall in
it, and they are set in among rubble, and are plainly a few pieces
from the upper wall above the gate. The reservoir which he
reaches is half a mile away across a depression several hundred feet
deep, and there is no possible connection, for the reservoir is over
on Colle San Martino, not on the hill of Pr&aelig;neste at all.</p>

<p> The postern or portella is just what one would expect near
a corner of the wall, as a less important and smaller entrance to
a terrace less wide than the main one above it, which had its big
gates at west and east, the Porta San Francesco and the Porta del
Cappuccini. The Porta San Francesco is proved old and famous
by C.I.L., XIV, 3343, where supra viam is all that is necessary
to designate the road from this gate. Again an antica via in Via
dello Spregato (Not. d. Scavi, I (1885), p. 139, shows that inside
this oldest cross wall there was a road part way along it, at least.)</p>

<p> This question is not topographical and can not be discussed
at
any length here. But the best solution seems to be that Fortuna
as child of Jupiter (Diovo filea primocenia, C.I.L., XIV., 2863,
Iovis puer primigenia, C.I.L., XIV, 2862, 2863) was confounded
with her name Iovis puer, and another cult tradition which made
Fortuna mother of two children. As the Roman deity Jupiter grew
in importance, the tendency was for the Romans to misunderstand
Iovis puer as the boy god Jupiter, as they really did (Wissowa,
Relig. u. Kult. d. Roemer, p. 209), and the pride of the
Pr&aelig;nestines
then made Fortuna the mother of Jupiter and Juno, and considered
Primigenia to mean "first born," not "first born of Jupiter."</p>

but he forgets comparisons with the date of other Roman mosaics,
and that Pliny would not have missed the opportunity of describing

<p>The latest discussion of the subject was a joint debate held under
the auspices of the Associazione Archeologica di Palestrina between
Professors Marucchi and Vaglieri, which is published thus far only
in the daily papers, the Corriere D'Italia of Oct. 2, 1907, and taken
up in an article by Attilio Rossi in La Tribuna of October 11, 1907.
Vaglieri, in the newspaper article quoted, holds that the mosaic is
the work of Claudius &AElig;lianus, who lived in the latter half of the
second century A.D. Marucchi, in the same place, says that in
the porticoes of the upper temple are traces of mosaic which he
attributes to the gift of Sulla mentioned by Pliny XXXVI, 189, but
in urging this he must shift delubrum Fortun&aelig; to the Cortina
terrace
and that is entirely impossible.
</p>
<p>I may say that a careful study and a long paper on the Barberini
mosaic has just been written by Cav. Francesco Coltellacci, Segretario
Comunale di Palestrina, which I had the privilege of reading
in manuscript.</p>

<p> This has been supposed to be a villa of Hadrian's because

proof that this building, which is under the modern cemetery, is
Hadrian's, is that the measurements of the walls are the same as
those in his villa below Tibur. Dr. Van Deman, of the American
School in Rome, spent two days with me in going over this building
and comparing measurements with the villa at Tibur. I shall

chamber of the same sort at the upper end of the shops in front
of the basilica &AElig;milia in the Roman Forum, to which Boni has
given the name "carcere," but Huelsen thinks rightly that it is a

show, I think, what Dessau (C.I.L., XIV, p. 288) says it does:
"quanta fuerit potestas imperatoris Romani in magistratus sociorum,"
but shows rather that the Roman dictator took advantage
of his power to pay off some of the ancient grudge against the
Latins, especially Pr&aelig;neste. The story of M. Marius at Teanum
Sidicinum, and the provisions made at Cales and Ferentinum on that
account, as told in Gellius X, 3, 2-3, also show plainly that not
constitutional powers but arbitrary ones, are in question. In fact,
it was in the year 173 B.C., that the consul L. Postumius Albinus,
enraged at a previous cool reception at Pr&aelig;neste, imposed a
burden
on the magistrates of the town, which seems to have been held
as an arbitrary political precedent. Livy XLII, 1: Ante hunc

<p> If it be objected that the survival of the dictatorship as a

office (Dictator Albanus, Orelli 2293, Marquardt, Staatsverw., I,
p. 149, n. 2) means only a dictator for Alba Longa, rather than for
the league of which Alba Longa seems to have been at one time
the head, there can be no question about the Dictator Latina(rum)
fer(iarum) caussa of the year 497 (C.I.L., I.p. 434 Fasti Cos.
Capitolini), the same as in the year 208 B.C. (Livy XXVII, 33,
6). This survival is an exact parallel of the rex sacrorum in Rome
(for references and discussion, see Marquardt, Staatsverw., III, p.
321), and the rex sacrificolus of Varro, de l.l. VI, 31. Compare
Jordan, Topog. d. Stadt Rom, I, p. 508, n. 32, and Wissowa, Rel.

<p> The real founder of Sulla's colony and the rebuilder of the
city of Pr&aelig;neste seems to have been M. Terentius Varro Lucullus.
This is argued by Vaglieri, who reports in Not. d. Scavi, 1907, p.
293 ff. the fragment of an architrave of some splendid building on
which are the letters ... RO.LVCVL ... These letters Vaglieri
thinks are cut in the style of the age of Sulla. They are fine deep
letters, very well cut indeed, although they might perhaps be put
a little later in date. An argument from the use of the name
Terentia, as in the case of Cornelia, will be of some service here.
The nomen Terentia was also very unpopular in Pr&aelig;neste. It occurs
but seven times and every inscription is well down in the late
imperial period. C.I.L., XIV, 3376, 3384, 2850, 4091, 75, 3273;

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
